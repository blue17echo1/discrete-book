<div class="para"> Vertices in a graph do not always have edges between them. If we add all possible edges, then the resulting graph is called <dfn class="terminology">complete</dfn>. That is, a graph is complete if every pair of vertices is connected by an edge. Since a graph is determined completely by which vertices are adjacent to which other vertices, there is only one complete graph with a given number of vertices. We give these a special name: <span class="process-math">\(K_n\)</span>  is the complete graph on <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> vertices.</div>
