<div class="para">Notice that we have not said how to make 44 cents, just that we can, on the basis that we can make 43 cents. How do we know we can make 43 cents? Perhaps because we know we can make <span class="process-math">\(42\)</span>  cents, which we know we can do because we know we can make 41 cents, and so on. It’s a recursion! As with a recursive definition of a numerical sequence, we must specify our initial value. In this case, the initial value is “<span class="process-math">\(P(1)\)</span> is false.” That’s not good, since our recurrence relation just says that <span class="process-math">\(P(k+1)\)</span> is true <em class="emphasis">if</em> <span class="process-math">\(P(k)\)</span> is also true. We need to start the process with a true <span class="process-math">\(P(k)\text{.}\)</span> So instead, we might want to use “<span class="process-math">\(P(28)\)</span> is true” as the initial condition.</div>
