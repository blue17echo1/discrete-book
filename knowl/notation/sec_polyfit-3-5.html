<div class="para">Not a huge surprise: one way to count the number of squares in a <span class="process-math">\(4 \times 4\)</span> chessboard is to notice that there are <span class="process-math">\(16\)</span> squares with side length 1, 9 with side length 2, 4 with side length 3 and 1 with side length 4. So the original sequence is just the sum of squares. Now this sequence of differences is not arithmetic since itâ€™s sequence of differences (the differences of the differences of the original sequence) is not constant. In fact, this sequence of <dfn class="terminology">second differences</dfn> is </div>

\begin{equation*}

\end{equation*}
</div>
<div class="para">which <em class="emphasis">is</em> an arithmetic sequence (with constant difference 2). Notice that our original sequence had <dfn class="terminology">third differences</dfn> (that is, differences of differences of differences of the original) constant. We will call such a sequence <span class="process-math">\(\Delta^3\)</span>-constant. The sequence <span class="process-math">\(1, 4, 9, 16, \ldots\)</span> has second differences constant, so it will be a <span class="process-math">\(\Delta^2\)</span>-constant sequence. In general, we will say a sequence is a <dfn class="terminology"><span class="process-math">\(\Delta^k\)</span>-constant</dfn>  sequence if the <span class="process-math">\(k\)</span>th differences are constant.</div>
