<div class="para"> For an upper bound, we can improve on “the number of vertices” by looking to the degrees of vertices. Let <span class="process-math">\(\Delta(G)\)</span>  be the largest degree of any vertex in the graph <span class="process-math">\(G\text{.}\)</span> One reasonable guess for an upper bound on the chromatic number is <span class="process-math">\(\chi(G) \le \Delta(G) + 1\text{.}\)</span> Why is this reasonable? Starting with any vertex, it together with all of its neighbors can always be colored in <span class="process-math">\(\Delta(G) + 1\)</span> colors, since at most we are talking about <span class="process-math">\(\Delta(G) + 1\)</span> vertices in this set. Now fan out! At any point, if you consider an already colored vertex, some of its neighbors might be colored, some might not. But no matter what, that vertex and its neighbors could all be colored distinctly, since there are at most <span class="process-math">\(\Delta(G)\)</span> neighbors, plus the one vertex being considered.</div>
