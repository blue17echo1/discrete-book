<div class="para">Hopefully you agree that the first argument is valid but the second argument is not. We will develop a better understanding of the logic involved in this analysis, but if your intuition agrees with this assessment, then you are in good shape.</div> <div class="para">Notice the two arguments look almost identical. Edith and Florence both eat their vegetables. In both cases there is a connection between the eating of vegetables and cookies. But we claim that it is valid to conclude that Edith gets a cookie, but not that Florence does. The difference must be in the connection between eating vegetables and getting cookies. We need to be skilled at reading and comprehending these sentences. Do the two sentences mean the same thing?</div> <div class="para">Unfortunately, in everyday language we are often sloppy, and you might be tempted to say they are equivalent. But notice that just because Florence <em class="emphasis">must</em> eat her vegetables, we have not said that doing so would be <em class="emphasis">enough</em> (she might also need to clean her room, for example). In everyday (non-mathematical) practice, you might be tempted to say this “other direction” is implied. In mathematics, we never get that luxury.</div>
