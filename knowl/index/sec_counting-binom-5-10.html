<div class="para">Any lattice path from (0,0) to (3,2) must pass through exactly one of <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(B\text{.}\)</span> The point <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> is 4 steps away from (0,0) and two of them are towards the right. The number of lattice paths to <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> is the same as the number of 4-bit strings of weight 2, namely 6. The point <span class="process-math">\(B\)</span> is 4 steps away from (0,0), but now 3 of them are towards the right. So the number of paths to point <span class="process-math">\(B\)</span> is the same as the number of 4-bit strings of weight 3, namely 4. So the total number of paths to (3,2) is just <span class="process-math">\(6+4\text{.}\)</span> This is the same way we calculated the number of 5-bit strings of weight 3. The point: the exact same recurrence relation exists for bit strings and for lattice paths.</div>
