<div class="para">There are <span class="process-math">\(4^5\)</span> functions all together; we will subtract the functions which are not surjective. We could exclude any one of the four elements of the codomain, and doing so will leave us with <span class="process-math">\(3^5\)</span> functions for each excluded element. This counts too many so we subtract the functions which exclude two of the four elements of the codomain, each pair giving <span class="process-math">\(2^5\)</span> functions. But this excludes too many, so we add back in the functions which exclude three of the four elements of the codomain, each triple giving <span class="process-math">\(1^5\)</span> function. There are <span class="process-math">\({4 \choose 1}\)</span> groups of functions excluding a single element, <span class="process-math">\({4 \choose 2}\)</span> groups of functions excluding a pair of elements, and <span class="process-math">\({4 \choose 3}\)</span> groups of functions excluding a triple of elements. This means that the number of functions which are <em class="emphasis">not</em> surjective is:</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation*}
{4 \choose 1}3^5 - {4 \choose 2}2^5 + {4 \choose 3}1^5 \text{.}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<div class="para">We can now say that the number of functions which are surjective is:</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation*}
4^5 - \left[{4 \choose 1}3^5 - {4 \choose 2}2^5 + {4 \choose 3}1^5\right] \text{.}

<div class="para">The number of surjective functions is:</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation*}

<div class="para">We took the total number of functions <span class="process-math">\(5^5\)</span> and subtracted all that were not surjective. There were <span class="process-math">\({5 \choose 1}\)</span> ways to select a single element from the codomain to exclude from the range, and for each there were <span class="process-math">\(4^5\)</span> functions. But this double counts, so we use PIE and subtract functions excluding two elements from the range: there are <span class="process-math">\({5 \choose 2}\)</span> choices for the two elements to exclude, and for each pair, <span class="process-math">\(3^5\)</span> functions. This takes out too many functions, so we add back in functions which exclude 3 elements from the range: <span class="process-math">\({5 \choose 3}\)</span> choices for which three to exclude, and then <span class="process-math">\(2^5\)</span> functions for each choice of elements. Finally we take back out the 1 function which excludes 4 elements for each of the <span class="process-math">\({5 \choose 4}\)</span> choices of 4 elements.</div>

<div class="para">If you happen to calculate this number precisely, you will get 120 surjections. That happens to also be the value of <span class="process-math">\(5!\text{.}\)</span> This might seem like an amazing coincidence until you realize that every surjective function <span class="process-math">\(f:X \to Y\)</span> with <span class="process-math">\(\card{X} = \card{Y}\)</span> finite must necessarily be a bijection. The number of bijections is always <span class="process-math">\(\card{X}!\)</span> in this case. What we have here is a <em class="emphasis">combinatorial proof</em> of the following identity:</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation*}
n^n - \left[{n\choose 1}(n-1)^n - {n \choose 2}(n-2)^n + \cdots + {n \choose n-1}1^n \right] = n! \text{.}
