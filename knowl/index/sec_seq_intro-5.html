<div class="para"> While we often just think of a sequence as an ordered list of numbers, it is really a type of function. Specifically, the sequence <span class="process-math">\((a_n)_{n\ge 0}\)</span> is a function with domain <span class="process-math">\(\N\)</span> where <span class="process-math">\(a_n\)</span> is the image of the natural number <span class="process-math">\(n\text{.}\)</span> Later we will manipulate sequences in much the same way you have manipulated functions in algebra or calculus. We can shift a sequence up or down, add two sequences, or ask for the rate of change of a sequence. These are done exactly as you would for functions.</div>
