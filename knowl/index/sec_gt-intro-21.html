<div class="para">The graphs are NOT equal, since <span class="process-math">\(\{a,d\}

How about we say <span class="process-math">\(f(a) = b\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(f(b) = c\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(f(c) = d\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(f(d) = a\text{.}\)</span> This is definitely a bijection, but to make sure that the function is an isomorphism, we must make sure it <em class="emphasis">respects the edge relation</em>.

So far, so good, but we must check the other three edges.
