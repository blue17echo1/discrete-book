It seems very powerful to be able to assume <span class="process-math">\(P(k)\)</span> is true. After all, we are trying to prove <span class="process-math">\(P(n)\)</span> is true and the only difference is in the variable: <span class="process-math">\(k\)</span> vs. <span class="process-math">\(n\text{.}\)</span> Are we assuming that what we want to prove is true? Not really. We assume <span class="process-math">\(P(k)\)</span> is true only for the sake of proving that <span class="process-math">\(P(k+1)\)</span> is true.</div> <div class="para">Still you might start to believe that you can prove anything with induction. Consider this incorrect “proof” that every Canadian  has the same eye color: Let <span class="process-math">\(P(n)\)</span> be the statement that any <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> Canadians have the same eye color. <span class="process-math">\(P(1)\)</span> is true, since everyone has the same eye color as themselves. Now assume <span class="process-math">\(P(k)\)</span> is true. That is, assume that in any group of <span class="process-math">\(k\)</span> Canadians, everyone has the same eye color. Now consider an arbitrary group of <span class="process-math">\(k+1\)</span> Canadians. The first <span class="process-math">\(k\)</span> of these must all have the same eye color, since <span class="process-math">\(P(k)\)</span> is true. Also, the last <span class="process-math">\(k\)</span> of these must have the same eye color, since <span class="process-math">\(P(k)\)</span> is true. So in fact, everyone the group must have the same eye color. Thus <span class="process-math">\(P(k+1)\)</span> is true. So by the principle of mathematical induction, <span class="process-math">\(P(n)\)</span> is true for all <span class="process-math">\(n\text{.}\)</span>
</div> <div class="para">Clearly something went wrong. The problem is that the proof that <span class="process-math">\(P(k)\)</span> implies <span class="process-math">\(P(k+1)\)</span> assumes that <span class="process-math">\(k \ge 2\text{.}\)</span> We have only shown <span class="process-math">\(P(1)\)</span> is true. In fact, <span class="process-math">\(P(2)\)</span> is false.  Try this: read through the previous paragraph again, substituting <span class="process-math">\(1\)</span> for each <span class="process-math">\(k\text{.}\)</span>  Can you spot the error in that argument?</div></section><span class="incontext"><a class="internal" href="sec_seq-induction.html#subsec_induction-examples-10">in-context</a></span>
