<div class="para"> Before we get too carried away, letâ€™s consider an example: How many squares (of all sizes) are there on a chessboard? A chessboard consists of <span class="process-math">\(64\)</span> squares, but we also want to consider squares of longer side length. Even though we are only considering an <span class="process-math">\(8 \times 8\)</span> board, there is already a lot to count. So instead, let us build a sequence: the first term will be the number of squares on a <span class="process-math">\(1 \times 1\)</span> board, the second term will be the number of squares on a <span class="process-math">\(2 \times 2\)</span> board, and so on. After a little thought, we arrive at the sequence</div>
