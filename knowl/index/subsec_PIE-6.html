<div class="para"> While we are thinking about sets, consider what happens to the additive principle when the sets are NOT disjoint. Suppose we want to find <span class="process-math">\(\card{A \cup B}\)</span> and know that <span class="process-math">\(\card{A} = 10\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(\card{B} = 8\text{.}\)</span> This is not enough information though. We do not know how many of the 8 elements in <span class="process-math">\(B\)</span> are also elements of <span class="process-math">\(A\text{.}\)</span> However, if we also know that <span class="process-math">\(\card{A \cap B} = 6\text{,}\)</span> then we can say exactly how many elements are in <span class="process-math">\(A\text{,}\)</span> and, of those, how many are in <span class="process-math">\(B\)</span> and how many are not (6 of the 10 elements are in <span class="process-math">\(B\text{,}\)</span> so 4 are in <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> but not in <span class="process-math">\(B\)</span>). We could fill in a Venn diagram as follows:</div>
