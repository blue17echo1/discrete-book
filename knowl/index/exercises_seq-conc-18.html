Thus the number of subsets is <span class="process-math">\(2= 2^1\text{.}\)</span> Thus <span class="process-math">\(P(1)\)</span> is true. Inductive case: Suppose <span class="process-math">\(P(k)\)</span> is true for some arbitrary <span class="process-math">\(k \ge 1\text{.}\)</span> Thus every set containing exactly <span class="process-math">\(k\)</span> elements has <span class="process-math">\(2^k\)</span> different subsets. Now consider a set containing <span class="process-math">\(k+1\)</span> elements: <span class="process-math">\(A = \{a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_k, a_{k+1}\}\text{.}\)</span> Any subset of <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> must either contain <span class="process-math">\(a_{k+1}\)</span> or not. In other words, a subset of <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> is just a subset of <span class="process-math">\(\{a_1, a_2,\ldots,
a_k\}\)</span> with or without <span class="process-math">\(a_{k+1}\text{.}\)</span> Thus there are <span class="process-math">\(2^k\)</span> subsets of <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> which contain <span class="process-math">\(a_{k+1}\)</span> and another <span class="process-math">\(2^{k+1}\)</span> subsets of <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> which do not contain <span class="process-math">\(a^{k+1}\text{.}\)</span> This gives a total of <span class="process-math">\(2^k + 2^k = 2\cdot 2^k = 2^{k+1}\)</span> subsets of <span class="process-math">\(A\text{.}\)</span> But our choice of <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> was arbitrary, so this works for any subset containing <span class="process-math">\(k+1\)</span> elements, so <span class="process-math">\(P(k+1)\)</span> is true. Therefore, by the principle of mathematical induction, <span class="process-math">\(P(n)\)</span> is true for all <span class="process-math">\(n \ge 1\text{.}\)</span>
