<div class="para"> As a final contrast between the two forms of induction, consider once more the stamp problem. Regular induction worked by showing how to increase postage by one cent (either replacing three 5-cent stamps with two 8-cent stamps, or three 8-cent stamps with five 5-cent stamps). We could give a slightly different proof using strong induction. First, we could show <em class="emphasis">five</em> base cases: it is possible to make 28, 29, 30, 31, and 32 cents (we would actually say how each of these is made). Now assume that it is possible to make <span class="process-math">\(k\)</span> cents of postage for all <span class="process-math">\(k \lt n\)</span> as long as <span class="process-math">\(k \ge 28\text{.}\)</span> As long as <span class="process-math">\(n &gt; 32\text{,}\)</span> this means in particular we can make <span class="process-math">\(k = n-5\)</span> cents. Now add a 5-cent stamp to get make <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> cents.</div>
