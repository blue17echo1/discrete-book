<div class="para"> We say <span class="process-math">\(P(n,k)\)</span> counts <em class="emphasis">permutations</em>, and <span class="process-math">\({n \choose k}\)</span> counts <em class="emphasis">combinations</em>. The formulas for each are very similar, there is just an extra <span class="process-math">\(k!\)</span> in the denominator of <span class="process-math">\({n \choose k}\text{.}\)</span> That extra <span class="process-math">\(k!\)</span> accounts for the fact that <span class="process-math">\({n \choose
k}\)</span> does not distinguish between the different orders that the <span class="process-math">\(k\)</span> objects can appear in. We are just selecting (or choosing) the <span class="process-math">\(k\)</span> objects, not arranging them. Perhaps “combination” is a misleading label. We don’t mean it like a combination lock (where the order would definitely matter). Perhaps a better metaphor is a combination of flavors — you just need to decide which flavors to combine, not the order in which to combine them.</div>
