<div class="para">Another way to compare sets is by their <em class="emphasis">size</em>. Notice that in the example above, <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> has 6 elements and <span class="process-math">\(B\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(C\text{,}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(D\)</span> all have 3 elements. The size of a set is called the setâ€™s <dfn class="terminology">cardinality</dfn> .  We would write <span class="process-math">\(|A| = 6\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(|B| = 3\text{,}\)</span> and so on. For sets that have a finite number of elements, the cardinality of the set is simply the number of elements in the set. Note that the cardinality of <span class="process-math">\(\{ 1, 2, 3, 2, 1\}\)</span> is 3. We do not count repeats (in fact, <span class="process-math">\(\{1, 2, 3, 2, 1\}\)</span> is exactly the same set as <span class="process-math">\(\{1, 2, 3\}\)</span>). There are sets with infinite cardinality, such as <span class="process-math">\(\N\text{,}\)</span> the set of rational numbers (written <span class="process-math">\(\mathbb Q\)</span>), the set of even natural numbers, and the set of real numbers (<span class="process-math">\(\mathbb R\)</span>). It is possible to distinguish between different infinite cardinalities, but that is beyond the scope of this text. For us, a set will either be infinite, or finite; if it is finite, the we can determine its cardinality by counting elements.</div>
