<section class="paragraphs"><h4 class="heading"><span class="title">Implicit Quantifiers.</span></h4>  <div class="para">It is always a good idea to be precise in mathematics. Sometimes though, we can relax a little bit, as long as we all agree on a convention. An example of such a convention is to assume that sentences containing predicates with free variables are intended as statements, where the variables are universally quantified.</div> <div class="para logical">
<div class="para">For example, do you believe that if a shape is a square, then it is a rectangle?  But how can that be true if it is not a statement?  To be a little more precise, we have two predicates: <span class="process-math">\(S(x)\)</span> standing for “<span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> is a square” and <span class="process-math">\(R(x)\)</span> standing for “<span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> is a rectangle”. The <em class="emphasis">sentence</em> we are looking at is,</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation*}
S(x) \imp R(x)\text{.}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<div class="para">This is neither true nor false, as it is not a statement. But come on!  We all know that we meant to consider the statement,</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation*}
\forall x (S(x) \imp R(x))\text{,}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<div class="para">and this is what our convention tells us to consider. When we add enough universal quantifiers to the beginning of a sentence so that all free variables become bound, we call the resulting statement the <dfn class="terminology">universal generalization</dfn> of the original sentence.</div>
</div> <div class="para">Similarly, we will often be a bit sloppy about the distinction between a predicate and a statement. For example, we might write, <em class="emphasis">let <span class="process-math">\(P(n)\)</span> be the <em class="emphasis">statement</em>, “<span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> is prime,”</em> which is technically incorrect. It is implicit that we mean that we are defining <span class="process-math">\(P(n)\)</span> to be a predicate, which for each <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> becomes the statement, <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> is prime.</div></section><span class="incontext"><a class="internal" href="sec_logic-quant.html#pars-implicituantifiers">in-context</a></span>
