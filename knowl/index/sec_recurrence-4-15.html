<div class="para">Although we will not consider examples more complicated than these, this characteristic root technique can be applied to much more complicated recurrence relations.  For example, <span class="process-math">\(a_n = 2a_{n-1} + a_{n-2} - 3a_{n-3}\)</span> has characteristic polynomial <span class="process-math">\(x^3 - 2 x^2 - x + 3\text{.}\)</span> Assuming you see how to factor such a degree 3 (or more) polynomial you can easily find the characteristic roots and as such solve the recurrence relation (the solution would look like <span class="process-math">\(a_n = ar_1^n + br_2^n + cr_3^n\)</span> if there were 3 distinct roots).  It is also possible that the characteristics roots are complex numbers. </div>
