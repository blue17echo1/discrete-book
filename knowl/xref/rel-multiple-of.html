<div class="para">This relation is not a graph for two reasons: first, elements are related to themselves, and second, the order of elements in the relation is not symmetric (<span class="process-math">\(6\)</span> is related to <span class="process-math">\(2\text{,}\)</span> but <span class="process-math">\(2\)</span> is not related to <span class="process-math">\(6\text{,}\)</span> for example).</div>
</div> <div class="para">We can, however, still draw something like a graph to illustrate this relation: Since the direction of the relation matters, we will have <em class="emphasis">directed</em> edges. This alone would create a <dfn class="terminology">directed graph</dfn>. Since vertices can have edges going to themselves, we would call the structure a <dfn class="terminology">multigraph</dfn>, so the relation can be thought of as a <dfn class="terminology">directed multigraph</dfn>
