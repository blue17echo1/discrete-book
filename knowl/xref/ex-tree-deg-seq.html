<li><div class="para">This must be the degree sequence for a tree. This is because the vertex of degree 4 must be adjacent to the four vertices of degree 1 (there are no other vertices for it to be adjacent to), and thus we get a star.</div></li>
<li>
<div class="para">This cannot be a tree. Each degree 3 vertex is adjacent to all but one of the vertices in the graph. Thus each must be adjacent to one of the degree 1 vertices (and not the other). That means both degree 3 vertices are adjacent to the degree 2 vertex, and to each other, so that means there is a cycle.</div>
<div class="para">Alternatively, count how many edges there are!</div>
</li>
<li><div class="para">This might or might not be a tree. The length 4 path has this degree sequence (this is a tree), but so does the union of a 3-cycle and a length 1 path (which is not connected, so not a tree).</div></li>
<li><div class="para">This cannot be a tree. The sum of the degrees is 28, so there are 14 edges. But there are 14 vertices as well, so we donâ€™t have <span class="process-math">\(v = e+1\text{,}\)</span> meaning this cannot be a tree.</div></li>
