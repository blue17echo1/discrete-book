<div class="para">This is an “if and only if” statement, so we must prove two implications.  We start by proving that if <span class="process-math">\(T\)</span> is a tree, then between every pair of distinct vertices there is a unique path.</div> <div class="para">Assume <span class="process-math">\(T\)</span> is a tree, and let <span class="process-math">\(u\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(v\)</span> be distinct vertices (if <span class="process-math">\(T\)</span> only has one vertex, then the conclusion is satisfied automatically).  We must show two things to show that there is a unique path between <span class="process-math">\(u\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(v\text{:}\)</span> that there is a path, and that there is not more than one path.  The first of these is automatic, since <span class="process-math">\(T\)</span> is a tree, it is connected, so there is a path between any pair of vertices.</div> <div class="para">To show the path is unique, we suppose there are two paths between <span class="process-math">\(u\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(v\text{,}\)</span> and get a contradiction.  The two paths might start out the same, but since they are different, there is some first vertex <span class="process-math">\(u'\)</span> after which the two paths diverge.  However, since the two paths both end at <span class="process-math">\(v\text{,}\)</span> there is some first vertex after <span class="process-math">\(u'\)</span> that they have in common, call it <span class="process-math">\(v'\text{.}\)</span>  Now consider the two paths from <span class="process-math">\(u'\)</span> to <span class="process-math">\(v'\text{.}\)</span>  Taken together, these form a cycle, which contradicts our assumption that <span class="process-math">\(T\)</span> is a tree.</div> <div class="para">Now we consider the converse: if between every pair of distinct vertices of <span class="process-math">\(T\)</span> there is a unique path, then <span class="process-math">\(T\)</span> is a tree.  So assume the hypothesis: between every pair of distinct vertices of <span class="process-math">\(T\)</span> there is a unique path.  To prove that <span class="process-math">\(T\)</span> is a tree, we must show it is connected and contains no cycles.</div> <div class="para">The first half of this is easy: <span class="process-math">\(T\)</span> is connected, because there is a path between every pair of vertices.  To show that <span class="process-math">\(T\)</span> has no cycles, we assume it does, for the sake of contradiction.  Let <span class="process-math">\(u\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(v\)</span> be two distinct vertices in a cycle of <span class="process-math">\(T\text{.}\)</span>  Since we can get from <span class="process-math">\(u\)</span> to <span class="process-math">\(v\)</span> by going clockwise or counterclockwise around the cycle, there are two paths from <span class="process-math">\(u\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(v\text{,}\)</span> contradicting our assumption.</div> <div class="para">We have established both directions so we have completed the proof.</div></article><span class="incontext"><a class="internal" href="sec_trees.html#prop-unique-paths-trees">in-context</a></span>
