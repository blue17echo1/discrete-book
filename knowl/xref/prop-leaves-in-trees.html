<div class="para">We give a proof by contradiction.  Let <span class="process-math">\(T\)</span> be a tree with at least two vertices, and suppose, contrary to stipulation, that there are not two vertices of degree one.</div> <div class="para">Let <span class="process-math">\(P\)</span> be a path in <span class="process-math">\(T\)</span> of longest possible length.  Let <span class="process-math">\(u\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(v\)</span> be the endpoints of the path.  Since <span class="process-math">\(T\)</span> does not have two vertices of degree one, at least one of these must have degree two or higher.  Say that it is <span class="process-math">\(u\text{.}\)</span>  We know that <span class="process-math">\(u\)</span> is adjacent to a vertex in the path <span class="process-math">\(P\text{,}\)</span> but now it must also be adjacent to another vertex, call it <span class="process-math">\(u'\text{.}\)</span>
</div> <div class="para">Where is <span class="process-math">\(u'\text{?}\)</span>  It cannot be a vertex of <span class="process-math">\(P\text{,}\)</span> because if it was, there would be two distinct paths from <span class="process-math">\(u\)</span> to <span class="process-math">\(u'\text{:}\)</span> the edge between them, and the first part of <span class="process-math">\(P\)</span> (up to <span class="process-math">\(u'\)</span>).  But <span class="process-math">\(u'\)</span> also cannot be outside of <span class="process-math">\(P\text{,}\)</span> for if it was, there would be a path from <span class="process-math">\(u'\)</span> to <span class="process-math">\(v\)</span> that was longer than <span class="process-math">\(P\text{,}\)</span> which has longest possible length.</div> <div class="para">This contradiction proves that there must be at least two vertices of degree one.  In fact, we can say a little more: <span class="process-math">\(u\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(v\)</span> must <em class="emphasis">both</em> have degree one.</div></article><span class="incontext"><a class="internal" href="sec_trees.html#prop-leaves-in-trees">in-context</a></span>
