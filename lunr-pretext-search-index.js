  "body": " This book would not exist if not for Discrete and Combinatorial Mathematics by Richard Grassl and Tabitha Mingus. It is the book I learned discrete math out of, and taught out of the semester before I began writing this text. I wanted to maintain the inquiry based feel of their book but update, expand and rearrange some of the material. Some of the best exposition and exercises here were graciously donated from this source.  Thanks to Alees Seehausen who co-taught the Discrete Mathematics course with me in 2015 and helped develop many of the Investigate! activities and other problems currently used in the text. She also offered many suggestions for improvement of the expository text, for which I am quite grateful. Thanks also to Katie Morrison, Nate Eldredge and Richard Grassl (again) for their suggestions after using parts of this text in their classes.  While there are likely still errors and typos in the current book, there are many fewer thanks to the work of Michelle Morgan over the summer of 2016.  The book is now available in an interactive online format, and this is entirely thanks to the work of Rob Beezer, David Farmer, and Alex Jordan along with the rest of the participants of the pretext-support group .  Finally, a thank you to the numerous students who have pointed out typos and made suggestions over the years and a thanks in advance to those who will do so in the future.  "

  "body": " This text aims to give an introduction to select topics in discrete mathematics at a level appropriate for first or second year undergraduate math majors, especially those who intend to teach middle and high school mathematics. The book began as a set of notes for the Discrete Mathematics course at the University of Northern Colorado. This course serves both as a survey of the topics in discrete math and as the bridge course for math majors, as UNC does not offer a separate introduction to proofs course. Most students who take the course plan to teach, although there are a handful of students who will go on to graduate school or study applied math or computer science. For these students the current text hopefully is still of interest, but the intent is not to provide a solid mathematical foundation for computer science, unlike the majority of textbooks on the subject.  Another difference between this text and most other discrete math books is that this book is intended to be used in a class taught using problem oriented or inquiry based methods. When I teach the class, I will assign sections for reading after first introducing them in class by using a mix of group work and class discussion on a few interesting problems. The text is meant to consolidate what we discover in class and serve as a reference for students as they master the concepts and techniques covered in the unit. None-the-less, every attempt has been made to make the text sufficient for self study as well, in a way that hopefully mimics an inquiry based classroom.  The topics covered in this text were chosen to match the needs of the students I teach at UNC. The main areas of study are combinatorics, sequences, logic and proofs, and graph theory, in that order. Induction is covered at the end of the chapter on sequences. Most discrete books put logic first as a preliminary, which certainly has its advantages. However, I wanted to discuss logic and proofs together, and found that doing both of these before anything else was overwhelming for my students given that they didn't yet have context of other problems in the subject. Also, after spending a couple weeks on proofs, we would hardly use that at all when covering combinatorics, so much of the progress we made was quickly lost. Instead, there is a short introduction section on mathematical statements, which should provide enough common language to discuss the logical content of combinatorics and sequences.  Depending on the speed of the class, it might be possible to include additional material. In past semesters I have included generating functions (after sequences) and some basic number theory (either after the logic and proofs chapter or at the very end of the course). These additional topics are covered in the last chapter.  While I (currently) believe this selection and order of topics is optimal, you should feel free to skip around to what interests you. There are occasionally examples and exercises that rely on earlier material, but I have tried to keep these to a minimum and usually can either be skipped or understood without too much additional study. If you are an instructor, feel free to edit the latex or PreTeXt source to fit your needs.   Improvements to the 3rd Edition  In addition to lots of minor corrections, both to typographical and mathematical errors, this third edition includes a few major improvements, including:   More than 100 new exercises, bringing the total to 473. The selection of which exercises have solutions has also been improved, which should make the text more useful for instructors who want to assign homework from the book.    A new section in on trees in the graph theory chapter.    Substantial improvement to the exposition in chapter 0, especially the section on functions.    The interactive online version of the book has added interactivity. Currently, many of the exercises are displayed as WeBWorK problems, allowing readers to enter answers to verify they are correct.     The previous editions (2nd edition, released in August 2016, and the Fall 2015 edition) will still be available for instructors who wish to use those versions due to familiarity.  My hope is to continue improving the book, releasing a new edition each spring in time for fall adoptions. These new editions will incorporate additions and corrections suggested by instructors and students who use the text the previous semesters. Thus I encourage you to send along any suggestions and comments as you have them.    Oscar Levin, Ph.D.  University of Northern Colorado, 2019  "

  "title": "How to use this book",
  "body": " How to use this book  In addition to expository text, this book has a few features designed to encourage you to interact with the mathematics.   Investigate! activities  Sprinkled throughout the sections (usually at the very beginning of a topic) you will find activities designed to get you acquainted with the topic soon to be discussed. These are similar (sometimes identical) to group activities I give students to introduce material. You really should spend some time thinking about, or even working through, these problems before reading the section. By priming yourself to the types of issues involved in the material you are about to read, you will better understand what is to come. There are no solutions provided for these problems, but don't worry if you can't solve them or are not confident in your answers. My hope is that you will take this frustration with you while you read the proceeding section. By the time you are done with the section, things should be much clearer.    Examples  I have tried to include the correct number of examples. For those examples which include problems , full solutions are included. Before reading the solution, try to at least have an understanding of what the problem is asking. Unlike some textbooks, the examples are not meant to be all inclusive for problems you will see in the exercises. They should not be used as a blueprint for solving other problems. Instead, use the examples to deepen our understanding of the concepts and techniques discussed in each section. Then use this understanding to solve the exercises at the end of each section.    Exercises  You get good at math through practice. Each section concludes with a small number of exercises meant to solidify concepts and basic skills presented in that section. At the end of each chapter, a larger collection of similar exercises is included (as a sort of chapter review ) which might bridge material of different sections in that chapter. Many exercise have a hint or solution (which in the PDF version of the text can be found by clicking on the exercise number clicking on the solution number will bring you back to the exercise). Readers are encouraged to try these exercises before looking at the help.  Both hints and solutions are intended as a way to check your work, but often what would count as a correct solution in a math class would be quite a bit more. When I teach with this book, I assign exercises that have solutions as practice and then use them, or similar problems, on quizzes and exams. There are also problems without solutions to challenge yourself (or to be assigned as homework).    Interactive Online Version  For those of you reading this in a PDF or in print, I encourage you to also check out the interactive online version, which makes navigating the book a little easier. Additionally, some of the exercises are implemented as WeBWorK problems, which allow you to check your work without seeing the correct answer immediately. Additional interactivity is planned, including instructional videos for examples and additional exercises at the end of sections. These bonus features will be added on a rolling basis, so keep an eye out!  You can view the interactive version for free at or by scanning the QR code below with your smart phone.      "

  "title": "What is Discrete Mathematics?",
  "body": " What is Discrete Mathematics?   dis crete \/ dis'krët.   Adjective : Individually separate and distinct.   Synonyms : separate - detached - distinct - abstract.   Defining discrete mathematics is hard because defining mathematics is hard. What is mathematics? The study of numbers? In part yes, but you also study functions and lines and triangles and parallelepipeds and vectors and . Or perhaps you want to say that mathematics is a collection of tools that allow you to solve problems. What sort of problems? Well, those that involve numbers, functions, lines, triangles, . Whatever your conception of what mathematics is, try applying the concept of discrete to it, as defined above. Some math fundamentally deals with stuff that is individually separate and distinct.  In an algebra or calculus class, you might have found a particular set of numbers (perhaps they constitute the range of a function). You would represent this set as an interval: is the range of since the set of outputs of the function are all real numbers 0 and greater. This set of numbers is NOT discrete. The numbers in the set are not separated by much at all. In fact, take any two numbers in the set and there are infinitely many more between them which are also in the set.  Discrete math could still ask about the range of a function, but the set would not be an interval. Consider the function which gives the number of children of each person reading this. What is the range? I'm guessing it is something like . Maybe 5 or 6 is in there too. Even larger natural numbers for old ladies who live in shoes. But certainly there is nobody reading this that has 1.32419 children. This output set is discrete because the elements are separate. The inputs to the function also form a discrete set because each input is an individual person.  There are many discrete mathematical objects besides sets of numbers; we will introduce some of these in . Studying these discrete structures is the main focus of discrete mathematics and this book. However, the reason we want to study these structures is because they provide a way to model real world problems. Many of the problems discussed in this book are admittedly contrived and clearly fictional, but hopefully you will see how these toy problems can be generalized to actually represent problems that people would care about in reality.   To get a feel for the subject, let's to consider the types of problems you solve in discrete math. Here are a few simple examples:    Note: Throughout the text you will see Investigate! activities like this one. Answer the questions in these as best you can to give yourself a feel for what is coming next.      The most popular mathematician in the world is throwing a party for all of his friends. As a way to kick things off, they decide that everyone should shake hands. Assuming all 10 people at the party each shake hands with every other person (but not themselves, obviously) exactly once, how many handshakes take place?    At the warm-up event for Oscar's All Star Hot Dog Eating Contest, Al ate one hot dog. Bob then showed him up by eating three hot dogs. Not to be outdone, Carl ate five. This continued with each contestant eating two more hot dogs than the previous contestant. How many hot dogs did Zeno (the 26th and final contestant) eat? How many hot dogs were eaten all together?    After excavating for weeks, you finally arrive at the burial chamber. The room is empty except for two large chests. On each is carved a message (strangely in English):   Exactly one of these chests contains a treasure, while the other is filled with deadly immortal scorpions.  For either chest, if the chest's message is true, then the chest contains treasure.   The problem is, you don't know whether the messages are true or false. What do you do?    Back in the days of yore, five small towns decided they wanted to build roads directly connecting each pair of towns. While the towns had plenty of money to build roads as long and as winding as they wished, it was very important that the roads not intersect with each other (as stop signs had not yet been invented). Also, tunnels and bridges were not allowed, for morality reasons. Is it possible for each of these towns to build a road to each of the four other towns without creating any intersections?      As you consider the problems above, don't worry if it is not obvious to you what the solutions are. We are more interested here in what sort of information we need to be able to answer the questions. How can were represent the situation using individually separate and distinct objects? Don't read on until you have thought about at least this for each of the questions.  Ready? Here are some things you might have thought about:   The people at the party are individuals. We can consider the set of people. We can then also consider sets of pairs of people, since it takes exactly two people to shake hands. So the question is really about, how many pairs can you make using elements from a 10-element set?  For example, if there were three people at the party, conviniently named , , and , then the pairs would be , , and . Or should we include , , and as well?    To count the number of hot dogs eaten, either by an individual or all together, we could use a sequence of integers (whole numbers). The th term in the sequence might represent the number of hot dogs eaten by the th contestant. We can consider a second sequence, also of integers, which gives the total number of hot dogs eaten by the first contestants combined.  The solution to the problem will then be the value of the 26th term in the sequence. To help us find this, we could consider the rate of growth of the sequences, as well as how these two sequences relate to each other.    Logic questions also belong under the discrete math umbrella: each statement can have a value of True or False (and there is nothing in-between). To answer questions like that of the chests of scorpions, we must understand the structure of the statements, and how the truth values of the parts of the statements interact to determine the truth value of the whole statement.    The last question is about a discrete structure called a graph , not to be confused with a graph of a function or set of points. We can use a graph to represent which elements of a set (or towns) are related to each other (or connected by a road). In this case, the question becomes, can we draw a graph with five vertices (towns) and ten edges (roads) such that no two edges intersect?     The four problems above illustrate the four main topics of this book: combinatorics (the theory of ways things combine ; in particular, how to count these ways), sequences , symbolic logic , and graph theory . However, there are other topics that are also considered part of discrete mathematics, including computer science, abstract algebra, number theory, game theory, probability, and geometry (some of these, particularly the last two, have both discrete and non-discrete variants).  Ultimately the best way to learn what discrete math is about is to do it. Let's get started! Before we can begin answering more complicated (and fun) problems, we will consider a very brief overview of the types of discrete structures we will be using.    Each section of the book will end with a small number of Reading Questions like the ones below. These are designed to help you reflect on what you have read. In particular, the final reading question asks you to ask a question of your own. Thinking about what you don't yet know is a wonderful way to further your understanding of what you do.    Right now, how would you describe what discrete mathematics is about, if you were telling your friends about the class you are in? Write one or two sentences.    What questions do you have after reading this section? Write at least one question about the content of this section that you are curious about.    "

  "body": " Discrete Structures   Introduction   A double-six domino set consists of tiles containing pairs of numbers, each from 0 to 6. How many tiles are in a double-six domino set? How many dominoes are in a double-nine domino set? How many dominoes are in a double- domino set?    Spend a few minutes thinking about the questions above. Then write 2-3 sentences describing your thoughts. You do not need to find a complete solution, but you should describe what you could try and what you think you might need to do to find a solution.   We are taking a problem solving approach to discrete mathematics: we will consider a large variety of questions that have a discrete feel to them, and consider how to answer those questions (and prove that our answers are correct). This is not the only way to study discrete math. Another approach would be to study the tools used to solve the problems. We could study paint brushes and easels and the composition of paint, which would be interesting for sure, but I think it is more enjoyable to actually paint and learn how to create happy little trees.  However, understanding your tools does help you use them, so in this section we will consider some of the basic tools used in discrete mathematics. We will come back to these throughout our studies and understand them better as we need to.    discrete structures  structures    structures  The tools in our subject are called discrete structures . They are the mathematical objects that we use to represent parts of the problems we are solving. Structure is a good word here, since these things have fairly rigid constraints that make them what they are, just like an apartment building is going to have different characteristics than an airplane hanger or a suspension bridge (these types of physical structures, not mathematical structures, just to be overly clear and destroy the metaphor).  The structures we will use most in discrete math are sets , functions , sequences , relations , and graphs . We will now briefly preview each of these. As we progress through our studies, each will be explored in more detail.     Sets  A set is an unordered collection of elements. This is fairly vague, but unless we want to spend a whole book trying to understand sets more precisely, it will be good enough for us. It is possible to define all of mathematics using just sets (even numbers can be thought of as sets themselves), but this is also not what we will do. Rather, we want to be able to talk about collections of numbers and other objects, and we will collect them in something we call a set .  We can describe sets by saying exactly what elements are members of the set. We could specify this membership in words (e.g., Let be the set of all natural numbers less than 10), or by explicitly listing all the elements (e.g. ) or using something called set comprehension (also called set builder notation ). And example of this is . We would read that as is the set of all natural numbers that satisfy the property that they are less than 10. More precisely, the symbol represents the natural numbers, which is itself a set: (this shows another way to describe a set). The symbol means is an element of . The is read such that and tells us that what comes next is the condition that must be true of the set's elements.   In this book, we have defined the natural numbers to be the whole numbers starting with 0. Not every book includes 0 in this set. It usually depends on what area of mathematics you study.   Since there are multiple ways to describe the same set, we should be careful about what it means for sets to be the same or different. A set is determined by its membership, so all four of the following describe exactly the same set:    .     . (How many numbers belong to this set? It's not 5.)     . (All that matters is what elements are in the collection, not what order they were written down in.)     .     There are lots of things you can do with sets, which we will consider in more detail as we need to. We will see that it is often helpful to build new sets from ones we already have (by taking the union or intersection of sets, for example), to compare sets (asking if one set is a subset of another), and to find the number of elements of a set (called its cardinality ). We might also want to match up elements of one set with another: to do this, we might use a function , which we will discuss next. Awesomely, we can also use sets themselves to describe functions. Let's check it out.    Functions    function    domain    codomain    image  of an element  One way to define a function is as a rule that assigns each input exactly one output. The output is called the image of the input. Functions also come equipped with a domain , the set of all inputs, and codomain , the set of all allowable outputs. You might also speak of the range of the function, which is the set of all actual outputs, or put another way, the set of all images of elements from the domain.  We write to describe a function with name , domain and codomain . This does not tell us which function is though. To define the function, we must describe the rule. Often ths is done with a formula (for example, says that each element of the domain is mapped to its square), or in words (like how we just described the squaring function). You could also define a function with a table or a graph.  The key thing that makes a rule a function is that there is exactly one output for each input. That is, it is important that the rule be a good rule. What output do we assign to the input 7? There can only be one answer for any particular function.  Since a function maps one set (the domain) to another set (the codomain), there is an obvious connection between sets and function. There is another connection worth considering though: the graph of a function is often described as a set of points. Here is an example.   Consider the function defined by . If we wanted to plot a graph of this function, we would draw the points , , and (but we would not connect these points with lines, since we are studying discrete math; the domain only contains three elements, not the infinitely many between them).  So associated with the function is the set of points . In fact, this set of points is associated exactly with this (and only this) function. So we can think of this set of points as the function itself .   Of course, we are using a mathematical object here: an ordered pair . This is not a set (since sets are unordered). How should we talk about ordered things? We will take this question up in the next section.  One last important consideration about how we describe a function: we will consider two basic sorts of formulas: closed and recursive. A closed formula is one in which each output is given by an explicit rule based solely on its input. This is what most of us think of as a formula. For example, is a closed formula, since to find (say) we take the input 5 and so something to it: multiply it by 5 and then add 1.  What else could a formula possibly be? A recursive definition of a function tells us how to compute the output for a given input based on other outputs of the function . For example, we might insist that . If we also specify an initial condition that , then we can find , and then , and so on. What is here? The only way to answer that is to find , which means we need to find , which we could do, since we have computed .  Recursive definitions of functions are often less useful in finding a particular output, but they are often easier to find for a particular application. We will explore this phenomenon more when we study sequences. Speaking of which...    Sequences  Sometimes we are interested not just in a collection of numbers, but in what order those numbers appear. In such cases, we cannot use sets , since they do not distinguish between the order of their elements. Instead, we consider sequences .  We will consider both finite and infinite sequences. A finite sequence my be something as simple as ; that is a sequence with 3 elements, in that particular order. We might also call this an ordered triple , the same way that is an ordered pair. In general, we could call this an -tuple if it has elements (we assume that tuples are ordered).  The key difference between the sequence and the set is that we care about the order. That is, the sequence is different from the sequence , while the set is exactly the same set as .  We will often use sequences as a counting tool. For example, a very simple counting question is, how many wheels do 100 cars have? Instead of answering just this one question, we could generalize and ask how many wheels cars have, and get a sequence of answers. This yields the infinite sequence . The order these multiples of 4 appear in is important, since each number in the sequence corresponds to a specific version of the question.  It is fine to think of a sequence of numbers as an ordered list. We can refer to the terms simply as and might refer to the entire sequence as or .  If we want to be a little more precise and more abstract, we can think of a sequence as a function . The domain is the natural numbers or some subset of consecutive natural numbers (like ). The codomain is some set. We think of the domain as the positions in the sequence, and the image of those inputs as the terms in the sequence.  For example, we might consider the Fibonacci sequence , which starts . What is the 4th term in the sequence? We might say (this is assuming the the first 1 is the first term and not the 0th term). Note that there can only be one 4th term. There can only be one -th term for any particular value of . So for any input (the position of the term) there is only one output (the term). It would be perfectly reasonable to write , and that really does look like a function. But we like to use subscripts.  We can also describe the terms in a sequence using a table. We might write something like the following:             1  2  3  4  ...       1  3  6  10  ...    This looks exactly like how you would describe a function, even though this table is describing the sequence of triangular numbers (we will see why they are called this later).  Since sequences are functions, we can use any of the techniques to describe functions to describe sequences. In particular, we might give a closed formula for a sequence by explicitly giving the function for the -th term. For example, . Alternatively, we could define a sequence recursively by saying how to get from one term to the next. This is especially useful for the Fibonacci sequence: .  A large amount of our effort in understanding sequences will go into taking a recursive definition and finding a closed formula for the sequence. We will study this, and everything else sequence related in .    Relations  How are the numbers and related? Oh, I know: . Also, is a multiple of . The two numbers are also both even. And here is another fact: they are not equal . All four of these are examples of relations : less than, multiple of, both even, not equal. And there are many more (infinitely many) relations that might or might not hold of a pair of two numbers.  The examples above are all binary relations in that they relate two elements. You could also consider relations between more than two elements. For example, we could consider the relation Pythagorean triple that holds of three numbers precisely if they are the side lengths of a right triangle. So the the relation is true of the triple , but not of (since but ).  Notice that we can talk about a pair or triple satisfying a relation. We might say that a pair belongs to the relation. In fact, the careful and formal way to define a relation is as a set of ordered pairs (or triples or etc.). Consider the (infinite) set of all ordered pairs such that . Every element of this set contains numbers for which the relation less than is true, and every pair of numbers for which the relation is true is a pair in the set. So we can say that this set of pairs is the relation.  Relations can have some standard properties, and deciding whether a particular relation has a given property can often help us understand the relation better. The less-than relation is, for example, irreflexive because there are no elements that are less than themselves. It is also antisymmetric since there are no distinct numbers and such that and . It is also transitive since if and then it must follow that . These are just a few examples of relation properties though.  Why would we care about these properties? It turns out that some groups of properties happen together often, and for such collections of properties, we can prove general results about the relations that satisfy them. So if we can prove that a given relation is reflexive , symmetric , and transitive (whatever those mean), then we know the relation is a equivalence relation , and therefore we know it has a bunch of other properties. A large portion of discrete mathematics is about studying particular types of relations. One of my favorites is a relation that gives us a graph.    Graphs  Consider the set . Which pairs of numbers from that set add up to 7? We could have or or . We can picture the set and the interesting (unordered) pairs (i.e., two-element subsets) as a picture called a graph:    The graph of pairs of numbers 1 to 6 that sum to 7  The graph of pairs of numbers 1 to 6 that sum to 7   On the other hand, we might want to consider pairs of numbers whose sum is even. Then, we would get the following picture.   The graph of pairs of numbers 1 to 6 that have an even sum    We call these discrete structures graphs . A graph is a type of relation, in particular one that is symmetric (if is related to , then is related to ) and irreflexive (no element is related to itself).  However, we mostly think of graphs as the drawings of dots and lines, or more precisely as a set of vertices together with a set of edges , where each edge is a two-element subset of the vertices. Notice, even here, we are using the structure set to define the structure graph .  Graphs show up in all sorts of real-world applications: in a class, some students are friends with each other, so take the students to be the vertices and the edges to be the friendships. In geography, some countries share a border, so take the countries to be the vertices and connect a pair of vertices with an edge if the countries share a border. Perhaps you are planning a trip and want to fly from Denver to Paris. Is there a direct flight, or do you need to stop in Newark? That is, does the graph of flights have an edge between Denver and Paris or only between Denver and Newark and between Newark and Paris? When your Amazon driver delivers packages to 10 houses in your neighborhood, how does her app know in which order to deliver the package? Graph theory!  The study of graphs is a subject in its own right, in which many mathematicians hold doctorate degrees and write hundreds of papers about each year. We will scratch the surface of this fascinating subject in      Even More Structures  Our list of structures could go on and on, but we will stop here. We will not spend much time at all looking at multisets , which are just like sets except can have repeated elements. Since this is not a geometry class, we will not consider finite geometries , or designs (which are somewhere between graphs and geometries). Discrete structures are useful in computer science, but we will stop short of studying linked lists or rooted trees . Although abstract algebra is a fascinating subject, we will not get to groups or rings or metroids or POSets or Boolean algebras or ... These are examples of sets on which we define additional operations and study the algebraic structure of how the sets and operations interact.  The point is, discrete mathematics is awesome and you can spend multiple lifetimes studying it. So what are we waiting for? Let's dive in and solve some problems.   "

  "body": " Mathematical Statements   Introduction    knights and knaves  puzzle knights and knaves  While walking through a fictional forest, you encounter three trolls guarding a bridge. Each is either a knight , who always tells the truth, or a knave , who always lies. The trolls will not let you pass until you correctly identify each as either a knight or a knave. Each troll makes a single statement:   Troll 1: If I am a knave, then there are exactly two knights here.  Troll 2: Troll 1 is lying.  Troll 3: Either we are all knaves or at least one of us is a knight.   Which troll is which? self reference reference, self  reference, self self reference     Spend a few minutes thinking about the Investigate problem above. What could you conclude if you knew Troll 1 really was a knave (i.e., their statement was false)? Share your initial thoughts on this.   In order to do mathematics, we must be able to talk and write about mathematics. Perhaps your experience with mathematics so far has mostly involved finding numerical answers to problems. As we embark towards more advanced and abstract mathematics, writing will play a more prominent role in the mathematical process.  In fact, the primary goal of mathematics, as an academic discipline in its own right, is to establish general mathematical truths. How can we know whether these facts, perhaps called theorems or propositions , are true? We construct valid arguments, called proofs , which establish the truth of the statements. Here, an argument is not the sort of thing you have with your Mom when you disagree about what to have for dinner. Rather, we have a technical definition of the term.   Argument   An argument  argument is a sequence of statements, the last of which is called the conclusion  conclusion and the rest of which are called premises . premises   An argument is said to be valid  valid provided the conclusion must be true whenever the premises are all true. An argument is invalid if it is not valid; that is, it is possible for all the premises to be true and the conclusion to be false.  An argument is sound provided it is valid and all the premises are true. A proof of a statement is a sound argument whose conclusion is the statement.     Our definitions of argument , valid argument , and sound argument are the same ones used in philosophy, the other primary academic discipline that is concerned with logic and reasoning.   So to determine whether we have a proof of a statement, we must decide both whether the sequence of premises are each true, and whether the argument is valid: whether the conclusion follows from the premises. How can we do this?    Consider the following two arguments:     If Edith eats her vegetables, then she can have a cookie.     Edith eats her vegetables.     Edith gets a cookie.       Florence must eat her vegetables in order to get a cookie.     Florence eats her vegetables.     Florence gets a cookie.    (The symbol    therefore  means therefore )  Are these arguments valid?    Hopefully you agree that the first argument is valid but the second argument is not. We will develop a better understanding of the logic involved in this analysis, but if your intuition agrees with this assessment, then you are in good shape.  Notice the two arguments look almost identical. Edith and Florence both eat their vegetables. In both cases there is a connection between the eating of vegetables and cookies. But we claim that it is valid to conclude that Edith gets a cookie, but not that Florence does. The difference must be in the connection between eating vegetables and getting cookies. We need to be skilled at reading and comprehending these sentences. Do the two sentences mean the same thing?  Unfortunately, in everyday language we are often sloppy, and you might be tempted to say they are equivalent. But notice that just because Florence must eat her vegetables, we have not said that doing so would be enough (she might also need to clean her room, for example). In everyday (non-mathematical) practice, you might be tempted to say this other direction is implied. In mathematics, we never get that luxury.     The arguments in the example above illustrate another important point: even if you don't care about the advancement of human knowledge in the field of mathematics, becoming skilled at analyzing arguments is useful. And even if you don't want to give your grandmother a cookie. If you are using mathematics to solve problems in some other discipline, it is still necessary to demonstrate that your solution is correct. You better have a good argument that it is!   Since arguments are built up of statements, we should try to understand what a statement is.    A statement is a declarative sentence that is either true or false.    Notice that if the sentences in an argument were not able to be true or false, there would be no way to determine whether the argument was valid, since that describes a relationship between the truth values of the premises and conclusions.  The goal of this section is to explore the different shapes a statement can take. We will see that more complicated statements can be built up from simpler ones, entirely in ways that determine their truth value based on the truth values of their parts.    After completing this section, you should be able to do the following.     Identify the logical structure of statements to determine their truth value in terms of the truth values of their parts.    Explain the conditions under which an implication is true.    Identify statements as equivalent to a given implication or its converse.      Preview Activity   Before reading on to the main content of the section, complete this preview activity to start thinking about the types of questions this section will address.    Which of the following sentences should count as statements? That is, for which of the sentences below, could you potentially claim the sentence was either true or false? Select all that apply.     The sum of the first 100 positive integers.    This is not a statement. It is not even a complete sentence (there is no verb).      What is the sum of the first 100 positive integers?    This is a question. It is not a statement.      The sum of the first 100 positive integers is 5050.    This is a statement. It is either true or false (it happens to be true).      Is the sum of the first 100 positive integers 5050?    This is a question. The answer happens to be yes , but that is not the same as saying true . Questions are never statements.      The sum of the first 100 positive integers is 17.    This is clearly false. But since it is false, it is a statement!      Consider the statement, If I see a movie, then I eat popcorn (which happens to be true). Based solely on your intuition of English, which of the following statements mean the same thing? Select all that apply.     If I eat popcorn, then I see a movie.    This is not equivalent to the original statement. Maybe I also eat popcorn when I watch TV? In that case, the original statement would be true, but this one would be false.      If I don't eat popcorn, then I don't see a movie.    Correct.      It is necessary that I eat popcorn when I see a movie.    This is equivalent to the original statement (although here necessary is used in a logical sense).      To see a movie, it is sufficient for me to eat popcorn.    Just because I eat popcorn, doesn't mean I see a movie. I might eat popcorn in other situations. So this is not equivalent to the original statement.      I only watch a movie if I eat popcorn.    Another way of saying this is, I watch a movie only if I eat popcorn. This is equivalent to the original statement.      Suppose that your shady uncle offers you the following deal: If you loan him your car, then he will bring you tacos. In which of the following situations would it be fair to say that your uncle is a liar (i.e., that his statement was false)? Select all that apply.     You loan him your car. He brings you tacos.      You loan him your car. He never buys you tacos.      You don't loan him your car. He still brings you tacos.    Maybe he just really likes giving you tacos. That's not enough to say he was a liar, is it?      You don't loan him your car. He never brings you tacos.        Atomic and Molecular Statements   statement  atomic statement  molecular statement A statement is any declarative sentence which is either true or false. A statement is atomic if it cannot be divided into smaller statements, otherwise it is called molecular .    These are statements (in fact, atomic statements):   Telephone numbers in the USA have 10 digits.    The moon is made of cheese.    42 is a perfect square.    Every even number greater than 2 can be expressed as the sum of two primes.        And these are not statements:   Would you like some cake?    The sum of two squares.    .   Go to your room!             sentence (compared to statement) The reason the sentence is not a statement is that it contains a variable. Depending on what is, the sentence is either true or false, but right now it is neither. One way to make the sentence into a statement is to specify the value of the variable in some way. This could be done by specifying a specific substitution, for example, where , which is a true statement. Or you could capture the free variable by quantifying over it, as in, for all values of , , which is false. We will discuss quantifiers in more detail in .   connectives  logical connectives You can build more complicated (molecular) statements out of simpler (atomic or molecular) ones using logical connectives . For example, this is a molecular statement:   Telephone numbers in the USA have 10 digits and 42 is a perfect square.    binary connective  unary connective Note that we can break this down into two smaller statements. The two shorter statements are connected by an and. We will consider 5 connectives: and (Sam is a man and Chris is a woman), or (Sam is a man or Chris is a woman), if , then (if Sam is a man, then Chris is a woman), if and only if (Sam is a man if and only if Chris is a woman), and not (Sam is not a man). The first four are called binary connectives (because they connect two statements) while not is an example of a unary connective (since it applies to a single statement).   truth value  propositional variable  variable, propositional  sentential variable propositional variable  Boolean variable propositional variable These molecular statements are of course still statements, so they must be either true or false. The absolutely key observation here is that which truth value the molecular statement achieves is completely determined by the type of connective and the truth values of the parts. We do not need to know what the parts actually say, only whether those parts are true or false. So to analyze logical connectives, it is enough to consider propositional variables (sometimes called sentential variables), usually capital letters in the middle of the alphabet: . We think of these as standing in for (usually atomic) statements, but there are only two values the variables can achieve: true or false. In computer programming, we should call such variables Boolean variables .   propositional (sentential) variables  We also have symbols for the logical connectives: , , , , .   Logical Connectives  logical connectives  connectives   We define the following logical connectives .   is read and , and called a conjunction . conjunction  and (logical connective)    logical and (conjunction)     disjunction  or (logical connective)  is read or , and called a disjunction .   logical or (disjunction)     is read if then , and called an implication or conditional . implication  conditional  implies (logical connective)  if , then (logical connective)    is read if and only if , and called a biconditional . biconditional  if and only if (logical connective)  iff if and only if    is read not , and called a negation . negation  not (logical connective)    logical negation         truth value The truth value of a statement is determined by the truth value(s) of its part(s), depending on the connectives:   Truth Conditions for Connectives  truth condition   The truth conditions for the logical connectives are defined as follows.   is true when both and are true.  and (logical connective)  truth condition for   truth condition for and    is true when or or both are true.  or (logical connective)  truth condition for   truth condition for or    is true when is false or is true or both.  implies (logical connective)  truth condition for    if , then (logical connective)  truth condition for   truth condition for if , then    is true when and are both true, or both false.  if and only if (logical connective)  truth condition for   truth condition for if and only if    is true when is false. not (logical connective) truth condition for  truth condition for not        or (logical connective) inclusive vs exclusive  inclusive or  exclusive or Note that for us, or is the inclusive or (and not the sometimes used exclusive or ) meaning that is in fact true when both and are true. As for the other connectives, and behaves as you would expect, as does negation. The biconditional (if and only if) might seem a little strange, but you should think of this as saying the two parts of the statements are equivalent in that they have the same truth value. This leaves only the conditional which has a slightly different meaning in mathematics than it does in ordinary usage. However, implications are so common and useful in mathematics, that we must develop fluency with their use, and as such, they deserve their own subsection.     Implications   Implications  implication  conditional  antecedent hypothesis  consequent conclusion  hypothesis  conclusion  An implication or conditional is a molecular statement of the form where and are statements. We say that   is the hypothesis (or antecedent ).   is the conclusion (or consequent ).    An implication is true provided is false or is true (or both), and false otherwise. In particular, the only way for to be false is for to be true and  to be false.    Pythagorean theorem Easily the most common type of statement in mathematics is the implication. Even statements that do not at first look like they have this form conceal an implication at their heart. Consider the Pythagorean Theorem . Many a college freshman would quote this theorem as . This is absolutely not correct. For one thing, that is not a statement since it has three variables in it. Perhaps they imply that this should be true for any values of the variables? So ??? How can we fix this? Well, the equation is true as long as and are the legs of a right triangle and is the hypotenuse. In other words:    If  and are the legs of a right triangle with hypotenuse , then  .   This is a reasonable way to think about implications: our claim is that the conclusion ( then part) is true, but on the assumption that the hypothesis ( if part) is true. We make no claim about the conclusion in situations when the hypothesis is false. However, note that in the case of the Pythagorean Theorem, it is also the case that if  , then  and are the legs of a right triangle with hypotenuse . So we could have also expressed this theorem as a biconditional: and are the legs of a right triangle with hypotenuse  if and only if  .    Still, it is important to remember that an implication is a statement, and therefore is either true or false. The truth value of the implication is determined by the truth values of its two parts. To agree with the usage above, we say that an implication is true either when the hypothesis is false, or when the conclusion is true. This leaves only one way for an implication to be false: when the hypothesis is true and the conclusion is false.    Consider the statement:   If Bob gets a 90 on the final, then Bob will pass the class.   This is definitely an implication: is the statement Bob gets a 90 on the final, and is the statement Bob will pass the class.   Suppose I made that statement to Bob. In what circumstances would it be fair to call me a liar? What if Bob really did get a 90 on the final, and he did pass the class? Then I have not lied; my statement is true. However, if Bob did get a 90 on the final and did not pass the class, then I lied, making the statement false. The tricky case is this: what if Bob did not get a 90 on the final? Maybe he passes the class, maybe he doesn't. Did I lie in either case? I think not. In these last two cases, was false, and the statement was true. In the first case, was true, and so was . So is true when either is false or is true.    Just to be clear, although we sometimes read as   implies   , we are not insisting that there is some causal relationship between the statements and . In particular, if you claim that is false , you are not saying that does not imply , but rather that is true and is false.    Decide which of the following statements are true and which are false. Briefly explain.   If , then most horses have 4 legs.    If , then .    If 8 is a prime number, then the 7624th digit of is an 8.    If the 7624th digit of is an 8, then .       All four of the statements are true. Remember, the only way for an implication to be false is for the if part to be true and the then part to be false.   Here both the hypothesis and the conclusion are true, so the implication is true. It does not matter that there is no meaningful connection between the true mathematical fact and the fact about horses.    Here the hypothesis is false and the conclusion is true, so the implication is true.    I have no idea what the 7624th digit of is, but this does not matter. Since the hypothesis is false, the implication is automatically true.    Similarly here, regardless of the truth value of the hypothesis, the conclusion is true, making the implication true.       It is important to understand the conditions under which an implication is true not only to decide whether a mathematical statement is true, but in order to prove that it is. Proofs might seem scary (especially if you have had a bad high school geometry experience) but all we are really doing is explaining (very carefully) why a statement is true. If you understand the truth conditions for an implication, you already have the outline for a proof.   Direct Proofs of Implications  implication direct proof for  direct proof for implication  To prove an implication , it is enough to assume , and from it, deduce .   Perhaps a better way to say this is that to prove a statement of the form directly, you must explain why is true, but you get to assume is true first. After all, you only care about whether is true in the case that is as well.  There are other techniques to prove statements (implications and others) that we will encounter throughout our studies, and new proof techniques are discovered all the time. Direct proof is the easiest and most elegant style of proof and has the advantage that such a proof often does a great job of explaining why the statement is true.    Prove: If two numbers and are even, then their sum is even.     Suppose the numbers and are even. This means that and for some integers and . The sum is then . Since is an integer, this means that is even.   Notice that since we get to assume the hypothesis of the implication, we immediately have a place to start. The proof proceeds essentially by repeatedly asking and answering, what does that mean? Eventually, we conclude that it means the conclusion.    This sort of argument shows up outside of math as well. If you ever found yourself starting an argument with hypothetically, let's assume , then you have attempted a direct proof of your desired conclusion.  An implication is a way of expressing a relationship between two statements. It is often interesting to ask whether there are other relationships between the statements. Here we introduce some common language to address this question.   Converse and Contrapositive      The converse  converse of an implication is the implication . The converse is NOT logically equivalent to the original implication. That is, whether the converse of an implication is true is independent of the truth of the implication.    The contrapositive  contrapositive of an implication is the statement . An implication and its contrapositive are logically equivalent (they are either both true or both false).       Mathematics is overflowing with examples of true implications which have a false converse. If a number greater than 2 is prime, then that number is odd. However, just because a number is odd does not mean it is prime. If a shape is a square, then it is a rectangle. But it is false that if a shape is a rectangle, then it is a square.  However, sometimes the converse of a true statement is also true. For example, the Pythagorean theorem has a true converse: if , then the triangle with sides , , and is a right triangle. Whenever you encounter an implication in mathematics, it is always reasonable to ask whether the converse is true.  The contrapositive, on the other hand, always has the same truth value as its original implication. This can be very helpful in deciding whether an implication is true: often it is easier to analyze the contrapositive.    True or false: If you draw any nine playing cards from a regular deck, then you will have at least three cards all of the same suit. Is the converse true?    True. The original implication is a little hard to analyze because there are so many different combinations of nine cards. But consider the contrapositive: If you don't have at least three cards all of the same suit, then you don't have nine cards. It is easy to see why this is true: you can at most have two cards of each of the four suits, for a total of eight cards (or fewer).  The converse: If you have at least three cards all of the same suit, then you have nine cards. This is false. You could have three spades and nothing else. Note that to demonstrate that the converse (an implication) is false, we provided an example where the hypothesis is true (you do have three cards of the same suit), but where the conclusion is false (you do not have nine cards).    Understanding converses and contrapositives can help understand implications and their truth values:    Suppose I tell Sue that if she gets a 93% on her final, then she will get an A in the class. Assuming that what I said is true, what can you conclude in the following cases:     Sue gets a 93% on her final.    Sue gets an A in the class.    Sue does not get a 93% on her final.    Sue does not get an A in the class.       Note first that whenever and are both true statements, must be true as well. For this problem, take to mean Sue gets a 93% on her final and to mean Sue will get an A in the class.      We have and , so follows. Sue gets an A.    You cannot conclude anything. Sue could have gotten the A because she did extra credit for example. Notice that we do not know that if Sue gets an , then she gets a 93% on her final. That is the converse of the original implication, so it might or might not be true.    The contrapositive of the converse of is , which states that if Sue does not get a 93% on the final, then she will not get an A in the class. But this does not follow from the original implication. Again, we can conclude nothing. Sue could have done extra credit.    What would happen if Sue does not get an A but did get a 93% on the final? Then would be true and would be false. This makes the implication false! It must be that Sue did not get a 93% on the final. Notice now we have the implication which is the contrapositive of . Since is assumed to be true, we know is true as well.       As we said above, an implication is not logically equivalent to its converse, but it is possible that both the implication and its converse are true. In this case, when both and are true, we say that and are equivalent and write . This is the biconditional we mentioned earlier.   If and only if  if and only if (logical connective)  biconditional    is logically equivalent to .   Example: Given an integer , it is true that is even if and only if is even. That is, if is even, then is even, as well as the converse: if is even, then is even.   You can think of if and only if statements as having two parts: an implication and its converse. We might say one is the if part, and the other is the only if part. We also sometimes say that if and only if statements have two directions: a forward direction and a backwards direction ( , which is really just sloppy notation for ).  Let's think a little about which part is which. Is the if part or the only if part? Consider an example.    Suppose it is true that I sing if and only if I'm in the shower. We know this means both that if I sing, then I'm in the shower, and also the converse, that if I'm in the shower, then I sing. Let be the statement, I sing, and be, I'm in the shower. So is the statement if I sing, then I'm in the shower. Which part of the if and only if statement is this?  What we are really asking for is the meaning of I sing if I'm in the shower and I sing only if I'm in the shower. When is the first one (the if part) false ? When I am in the shower but not singing. That is the same condition on being false as the statement if I'm in the shower, then I sing. So the if part is . On the other hand, to say, I sing only if I'm in the shower is equivalent to saying if I sing, then I'm in the shower, so the only if part is .    It is not terribly important to know which part is the if or only if part, but this does illustrate something very, very important: there are many ways to state an implication!     Rephrase the implication, if I dream, then I am asleep in as many different ways as possible. Then do the same for the converse.    The following are all equivalent to the original implication:   I am asleep if I dream.    I dream only if I am asleep.    In order to dream, I must be asleep.    To dream, it is necessary that I am asleep.    To be asleep, it is sufficient to dream.    I am not dreaming unless I am asleep.   The following are equivalent to the converse (if I am asleep, then I dream):   I dream if I am asleep.    I am asleep only if I dream.    It is necessary that I dream in order to be asleep.    It is sufficient that I be asleep in order to dream.    If I don't dream, then I'm not asleep.       Hopefully you agree with the above example. We include the necessary and sufficient versions because those are common when discussing mathematics. In fact, let's agree once and for all what they mean.   Necessary and Sufficient  necessary condition  sufficient condition       is necessary for  means .    is sufficient for  means .   If is necessary and sufficient for , then .       To be honest, I have trouble with these if I'm not very careful. I find it helps to keep a standard example for reference.    Recall from calculus, if a function is differentiable at a point , then it is continuous at , but that the converse of this statement is not true (for example, at the point 0). Restate this fact using necessary and sufficient language.    It is true that in order for a function to be differentiable at a point , it is necessary for the function to be continuous at . However, it is not necessary that a function be differentiable at for it to be continuous at .  It is true that to be continuous at a point , it is sufficient that the function be differentiable at . However, it is not the case that being continuous at is sufficient for a function to be differentiable at .    Thinking about the necessity and sufficiency of conditions can also help when writing proofs and justifying conclusions. If you want to establish some mathematical fact, it is helpful to think what other facts would be enough (be sufficient) to prove your fact. If you have an assumption, think about what must also be necessary if that hypothesis is true.     Give an example of a true implication (written out in words) that has a false converse. Explain why your implication is true and why the converse is false.    What questions do you have after reading this section? Write at least one question about the content of this section that we could answer in class or online.      Practice Problems    For each sentence below, decide whether it is an atomic statement, a molecular statement, or not a statement at all.    Eat your vegetables!    Sally ate her vegetables.    Sally ate her vegetables and got a cookie.           Classify each of the sentences below as an atomic statement, a molecular statement, or not a statement at all. If the statement is molecular, say what kind it is (conjuction, disjunction, conditional, biconditional, negation).    Everybody can be fooled sometimes.    The Broncos will win the Super Bowl or I'll eat my hat.    If a set contains three elements, then the sum of those elements is at least 6.    Every even number is divisible by 2    Every natural number greater than 1 is either prime or composite.           Determine whether each molecular statement below is true or false, or whether it is impossible to determine. Assume you do not know what my favorite number is (but you do know which numbers are prime).    7 is prime and 16 is not prime    If 7 is not prime, then 7 is my favorite number.    If 16 is my favorite number, then is my favorite number    16 is prime or 7 is prime    17 is my favorite number and 16 is not prime.    If 16 is not prime, then 16 is my favorite number.           In my safe is a sheet of paper with two shapes drawn on it in colored crayon. One is a square, and the other is a circle. Each shape is drawn in a single color. Suppose you believe me when I tell you that,  if the square is yellow, then the circle is purple.  What do you therefore know about the truth value of the following statements?    If the circle is purple, then the square is yellow.    The square is not yellow or the circle is purple.    The square the circle are both purple.    The square and the circle are both yellow.    If the circle is not purple, then the square is not yellow.     The main thing to realize is that we do not know the colors of these two shapes, but we do know that we are in one of three cases: We could have a yellow square and purple circle. We could have a square that was not yellow but a purple circle. Or we could have a square that was not yellow and a circle that was not purple. The case in which the square is yellow but the circle is not purple cannot occur, as that would make the statement false.         Suppose the statement, \"if the diamond is purple, then the circle is blue,\" is true. Assume also that the converse is false. Classify each statement below as true or false (if possible).    The diamond is purple if and only if the circle is blue.    The diamond is purple.    The circle is blue.    The diamond is purple if and only if the circle is not blue.     The only way for an implication to be true but its converse to be false is for to be true and to be false. Thus we know that circle is blue and that diamond is not purple.         Consider the statement, \"If you will give me a cow, then I will give you magic beans.\" Decide whether each statement below is the converse, the contrapositive, or neither.    If you will not give me a cow, then I will not give you magic beans.    If you will give me a cow, then I will not give you magic beans.    If I will give you magic beans, then you will not give me a cow.    If I will give you magic beans, then you will give me a cow.    You will give me a cow and I will not give you magic beans.    If I will not give you magic beans, then you will not give me a cow.     The converse is \"If I will give you magic beans, then you will give me a cow.\" The contrapositive is \"If I will not give you magic beans, then you will not give me a cow.\" All the other statements are neither the converse nor contrapositive.         You have discovered an old paper on graph theory that discusses the viscosity of a graph (which for all you know, is something completely made up by the author). A theorem in the paper claims that if a graph satisfies condition (V) , then the graph is viscous . Which of the following are equivalent ways of stating this claim? Which are equivalent to the converse of the claim?    Only viscous graphs satisfy condition (V).    Satisfying condition (V) is a sufficient condition for a graph to be viscous.    A graph is viscous only if it satisfies condition (V).    Every viscous graph satisfies condition (V).    Satisfying condition (V) is a necessary condition for a graph to be viscous.           Which of the following statements are equivalent to the implication, \" if you win the lottery, then you will be rich, \" and which are equivalent to the converse of the implication?    You will be rich only if you win the lottery.    You will be rich if you win the lottery.    Either you win the lottery or else you are not rich.    If you are rich, you must have won the lottery.    You will win the lottery if you are rich.           Additional Exercises   Suppose and are the statements: : Jack passed math. : Jill passed math.   Translate Jack and Jill both passed math into symbols.    Translate If Jack passed math, then Jill did not into symbols.    Translate   into English.    Translate   into English.    Suppose you know that if Jack passed math, then so did Jill. What can you conclude if you know that:  Jill passed math?  Jill did not pass math?          .  .   Jack passed math or Jill passed math (or both).    If Jack and Jill did not both pass math, then Jill did.      Nothing else.  Jack did not pass math either.         Consider the statement If Oscar eats Chinese food, then he drinks milk.    Write the converse of the statement.    Write the contrapositive of the statement.    Is it possible for the contrapositive to be false? If it was, what would that tell you?    Suppose the original statement is true, and that Oscar drinks milk. Can you conclude anything (about his eating Chinese food)? Explain.    Suppose the original statement is true, and that Oscar does not drink milk. Can you conclude anything (about his eating Chinese food)? Explain.       Write each of the following statements in the form, if , then . Careful, some of the statements might be false (which is alright for the purposes of this question).   To lose weight, you must exercise.    To lose weight, all you need to do is exercise.    Every American is patriotic.    You are patriotic only if you are American.    The set of rational numbers is a subset of the real numbers.    A number is prime if it is not even.    Either the Broncos will win the Super Bowl, or they won't play in the Super Bowl.         If you have lost weight, then you exercised.    If you exercise, then you will lose weight.    If you are American, then you are patriotic.    If you are patriotic, then you are American.    If a number is rational, then it is real.    If a number is not even, then it is prime. (Or the contrapositive: if a number is not prime, then it is even.)    If the Broncos don't win the Super Bowl, then they didn't play in the Super Bowl. Alternatively, if the Broncos play in the Super Bowl, then they will win the Super Bowl.       Consider the implication, if you clean your room, then you can watch TV. Rephrase the implication in as many ways as possible. Then do the same for the converse.   Of course there are many answers. It helps to assume that the statement is true and the converse is not true. Think about what that means in the real world and then start saying it in different ways. Some ideas: Use necessary and sufficient language, use only if, consider negations, use or else language.     "

  "body": " Propositional Logic   Introduction   Holmes always wears one of the two vests he owns: one tweed and one mint green. He always wears either the green vest or red shoes. Whenever he wears a purple shirt and the green vest, he chooses to not wear a bow tie. He never wears the green vest unless he is also wearing either a purple shirt or red shoes. Whenever he wears red shoes, he also wears a purple shirt. Today, Holmes is wore a bow tie. What else did he wear?    Spend a few minutes thinking about the Investigate! problem above. Of the six statements in the puzzle, only one is atomic. Use this atomic statement and one other statement to deduce a new statement about what Holmes might (or might not) be wearing. Explain why you think your new statement is true.   The atomic statement is Holmes wore a bow tie. Only one of the molecular statements has this as one of its atoms .    Propositional logic studies the ways statements can interact with each other (the term proposition is simply a synonym for statement ). More precisely, we consider the way the logical form of propositions interact. Thus, propositional logic does not really care about the content of the atomic statements that make up the propositions. For example, in terms of propositional logic, the claims, if the moon is made of cheese, then cheddar is a type of cheese, and if spiders have six legs, then Sam walks with a limp are exactly the same. That the first statement has two atomic parts that reference cheese is irrelevant. What we care about is that the two molecular statements have the same logical form: they are implications, .  Of course, in mathematics we often do know some relationship between various atomic statements (for the record, I do not know any such relationship between the moon's composition and cheddar). For example, we know a relationship between being even and being a multiple of 10. That relationship allows us to make claims such as, if the number I'm thinking of is a multiple of 10, then it is even. What can you conclude from the fact that I am now thinking of an odd number (i.e., not even)? If we accept both statements as true, we can deduce that that I am not thinking of a multiple of 10, and importantly, we can make this deduction without thinking about the nature of numbers. Being able to separate the content from the form of arguments can feel very liberating and provide much needed clarity when trying to understand complicated reasoning.  Our goal in this section is to establish some procedures for analyzing how the truth or falsity of statements interact, based on their logical form. We will see that some molecular statements must be true regardless of whether their atomic parts are true or false, while some statements must always be false. For other statements, it can be that two statements are always true or false together, or that whenever one statements is true, another statement must also be true.  The main method for establishing these relationships will be truth tables . There is a very clear procedure for constructing and analyzing truth tables, but for complicated arguments that contain many atomic statements, the truth tables become very large and unwieldy. We will therefore use truth tables to understand some basic equivalences and deductions, that can be applied in a sequence of reasoning to construct larger arguments.    After completing this section, you should be able to do the following.     Use truth tables to determine whether two statements are logically equivalent.    Use truth tables to determine whether a deduction rule is valid.    Use logical equivalence and deduction rules to simplify statements and make deductions.      Preview Activity   Before reading on to the main content of the section, complete this preview activity to start thinking about the types of questions this section will address.    Consider the statement, Whenever Holmes wears a purple shirt and the green vest, he chooses to not wear a bow tie. Let be the statement Holmes wears a purple shirt,  be the statement Holmes wears the green vest, and be the statement Holmes wears a bow tie. Which of the following is the best translation of the statement into propositional logic?                                 Consider the statement, Holmes never wears the green vest unless he is also wearing either a purple shirt or red shoes. With and as in the previous question, and being the statement Holmes wears red shoes, which of the following is the best translation of the statement into propositional logic?                 Consider the case where Holmes does wear a green vest but does not wear a purple shirt or red shoes. That would make false and true, so the implication would be true. But in this situation, the original statement would be false.           Consider the case where Holmes does not wear a purple shirt or red shoes, and does wear the green vest. That would make false and true, so the implication would be true. But in this situation, the original statement would be false.           Consider the case where Holmes does not wear a purple shirt or red shoes, and does wear the green vest. That would make false and false, so the implication would be true. But in this situation, the original statement would be false.      Consider the statement, if you major in math, then you will get a high paying job, and the statement, either you don't major in math or you will get a high paying job. In which of the following cases are both of the statement true? Select all that apply.     You major in math and get a high paying job.      You major in math and don't get a high paying job.    In fact, in this case, both of the statements are false.      You don't major in math and do get a high paying job.    This makes the implication true because the if part is false. The disjunction is true because the first part is true.      You don't major in math and don't get a high paying job.        Truth Tables  truth table   Here's a question about playing Monopoly:   If you get more doubles than any other player then you will lose, or if you lose then you must have bought the most properties.   True or false? We will answer this question, and won't need to know anything about Monopoly. Instead we will look at the logical form of the statement.  We need to decide when the statement is true. Using the definitions of the connectives in , we see that for this to be true, either must be true or must be true (or both). Those are true if either is false or is true (in the first case) and is false or is true (in the second case). So yeah, it gets kind of messy. Luckily, we can make a chart to keep track of all the possibilities. Enter truth tables . The idea is this: on each row, we list a possible combination of T's and F's (True and False) for each of the propositional variables, and then mark down whether the (molecular) statement in question is true or false in that case. We do this for every possible combination of T's and F's. Then we can clearly see in which cases the statement is true or false. For complicated statements, we will first fill in values for each part of the statement, as a way of breaking up our task into smaller, more manageable pieces.  Since the truth value of a statement is completely determined by the truth values of its parts and how they are connected, all you really need to know is the truth tables for each of the logical connectives. Here they are:                T  T  T    T  F  F    F  T  F    F  F  F                 T  T  T    T  F  T    F  T  T    F  F  F                 T  T  T    T  F  F    F  T  T    F  F  T                 T  T  T    T  F  F    F  T  F    F  F  T     The truth table for negation looks like this:             T  F    F  T        None of these truth tables should come as a surprise; they are all just restating the definitions of the connectives. Let's try another one.    Make a truth table for the statement .    Note that this statement is not , the negation belongs to alone. Here is the truth table:                   T  T  F  T    T  F  F  F    F  T  T  T    F  F  T  T     We added a column for to make filling out the last column easier. The entries in the column were determined by the entries in the column. Then to fill in the final column, look only at the column for and the column for and use the rule for .    Now let's answer our question about monopoly:    Analyze the statement, if you get more doubles than any other player you will lose, or that if you lose you must have bought the most properties, using truth tables.    Represent the statement in symbols as , where is the statement you get more doubles than any other player,  is the statement you will lose, and is the statement you must have bought the most properties. Now make a truth table.  The truth table needs to contain 8 rows in order to account for every possible combination of truth and falsity among the three statements. Here is the full truth table:                         T  T  T  T  T  T    T  T  F  T  F  T    T  F  T  F  T  T    T  F  F  F  T  T    F  T  T  T  T  T    F  T  F  T  F  T    F  F  T  T  T  T    F  F  F  T  T  T     The first three columns are simply a systematic listing of all possible combinations of T and F for the three statements (do you see how you would list the 16 possible combinations for four statements?). The next two columns are determined by the values of , , and and the definition of implication. Then, the last column is determined by the values in the previous two columns and the definition of . It is this final column we care about.  Notice that in each of the eight possible cases, the statement in question is true. So our statement about monopoly is true (regardless of how many properties you own, how many doubles you roll, or whether you win or lose).    The statement about monopoly is an example of a tautology , tautology  a statement which is true on the basis of its logical form alone. Tautologies are always true but they don't tell us much about the world. No knowledge about monopoly was required to determine that the statement was true. In fact, it is equally true that If the moon is made of cheese, then Elvis is still alive, or if Elvis is still alive, then unicorns have 5 legs.     Logical Equivalence  You might have noticed in that the final column in the truth table for is identical to the final column in the truth table for :                   T  T  T  T    T  F  F  F    F  T  T  T    F  F  T  T     This says that no matter what and are, the statements and either both true or both false. We therefore say these statements are logically equivalent .   Logical Equivalence   Two (molecular) statements and are logically equivalent  logical equivalence  provided is true precisely when is true. That is, and have the same truth value under any assignment of truth values to their atomic parts.    To verify that two statements are logically equivalent, you can make a truth table for each and check whether the columns for the two statements are identical.  Recognizing two statements as logically equivalent can be very helpful. Rephrasing a mathematical statement can often lend insight into what it is saying, or how to prove or refute it. By using truth tables we can systematically verify that two statements are indeed logically equivalent.    Are the statements, it will not rain or snow and it will not rain and it will not snow logically equivalent?    We want to know whether is logically equivalent to . Make a truth table which includes both statements:                   T  T  F  F    T  F  F  F    F  T  F  F    F  F  T  T     Since in every row the truth values for the two statements are equal, the two statements are logically equivalent.    Notice that this example gives us a way to distribute a negation over a disjunction (an or ). We have a similar rule for distributing over conjunctions ( and s):   De Morgan's Laws  De Morgan's laws    The negation of a disjunction or a conjunction are logically equivalent to conjunctions or disjunctions of negations, respectively. That is, and, .    This suggests there might be a sort of algebra you could apply to statements (okay, there is: it is called Boolean algebra ) to transform one statement into another. We can start collecting useful examples of logical equivalence, and apply them in succession to a statement, instead of writing out a complicated truth table.  De Morgan's laws do not do not directly help us with implications, but as we saw above, every implication can be written as a disjunction:   Implications are Disjunctions  implication equivalent disjunction   disjunction equivalent implication    .  Example: If a number is a multiple of 4, then it is even is equivalent to, a number is not a multiple of 4 or (else) it is even.    With this and De Morgan's laws, you can take any statement and simplify it to the point where negations are only being applied to atomic propositions. Well, actually not, because you could get multiple negations stacked up. But this can be easily dealt with:   Double Negation   double negation   .  Example: It is not the case that is not odd means is odd.    Let's see how we can apply the equivalences we have encountered so far.    Prove that the statements and are logically equivalent without using truth tables.    We want to start with one of the statements, and transform it into the other through a sequence of logically equivalent statements. Start with . We can rewrite the implication as a disjunction this is logically equivalent to . Now apply De Morgan's law to get . Finally, use double negation to arrive at     Notice that the above example illustrates that the negation of an implication is NOT an implication: it is a conjunction! We saw this before, in , but it is so important and useful, it warrants a second blue box here:   Negation of an Implication   The negation of an implication is a conjunction: . That is, the only way for an implication to be false is for the hypothesis to be true AND the conclusion to be false.    To verify that two statements are logically equivalent, you can use truth tables or a sequence of logically equivalent replacements. The truth table method, although cumbersome, has the advantage that it can verify that two statements are NOT logically equivalent.    Are the statements and logically equivalent?    Note that while we could start rewriting these statements with logically equivalent replacements in the hopes of transforming one into another, we will never be sure that our failure is due to their lack of logical equivalence rather than our lack of imagination. So instead, let's make a truth table:                      T  T  T  T  T    T  T  F  F  F    T  F  T  T  T    T  F  F  F  T    F  T  T  T  T    F  T  F  F  T    F  F  T  T  T    F  F  F  T  T        Look at the fourth (or sixth) row. In this case, is true, but is false. Therefore the statements are not logically equivalent.  While we don't have logical equivalence, it is the case that whenever is true, so is . This tells us that we can deduce  from , just not the reverse direction.      Deductions  Earlier we claimed that the following was a valid argument:   If Edith eats her vegetables, then she can have a cookie. Edith ate her vegetables. Therefore Edith gets a cookie.   How do we know this is valid? Let's look at the form of the statements. Let denote Edith eats her vegetables and denote Edith can have a cookie. The logical form of the argument is then:                      This is an example of a deduction rule , deduction rule  an argument form which is always valid. This one is a particularly famous rule called modus ponens . modus ponens   Are you convinced that it is a valid deduction rule? If not, consider the following truth table:                T  T  T    T  F  F    F  T  T    F  F  T     This is just the truth table for , but what matters here is that all the lines in the deduction rule have their own column in the truth table. Remember that an argument is valid provided the conclusion must be true given that the premises are true. The premises in this case are and . Which rows of the truth table correspond to both of these being true? is true in the first two rows, and of those, only the first row has true as well. And lo-and-behold, in this one case, is also true. So if and are both true, we see that must be true as well.  Here are a few more examples.    Show that the following is a valid deduction rule.                        We make a truth table which contains all the lines of the argument form:                      T  T  T  F  T    T  F  F  F  T    F  T  T  T  T    F  F  T  T  F     (we include a column for just as a step to help getting the column for ).  Now look at all the rows for which both and are true. This happens only in rows 1 and 3. Hey! In those rows is true as well, so the argument form is valid (it is a valid deduction rule).      Decide whether the following is a valid deduction rule.                             Let's make a truth table containing all four statements.                         T  T  T  T  T  T    T  T  F  F  F  T    T  F  T  T  T  T    T  F  F  F  T  T    F  T  T  T  T  T    F  T  F  T  F  T    F  F  T  T  T  F    F  F  F  T  T  F     Look at the second to last row. Here all three premises of the argument are true, but the conclusion is false. Thus this is not a valid deduction rule.  While we have the truth table in front of us, look at rows 1, 3, and 5. These are the only rows in which all of the statements , , and are true. It also happens that is true in these rows as well. Thus we have discovered a new deduction rule we know is valid:                                 To check whether two statements are logically equivalent, you can use a truth table. Explain what you would look for in the truth table to be able to conclude that the two statements are logically equivalent. What would tell you they are not logically equivalent?    To check whether a deduction rule is valid , you can use a truth table. Explain what you would look for in the completed truth table to say that the deduction rule is valid, and what would tell you the deduction rule is not valid.

They tell you:   Troll 1: If we are cousins, then we are both knaves.  Troll 2: We are cousins or we are both knaves.   Could both trolls be knights? Recall that all trolls are either always-truth-telling knights or always-lying knaves. Explain your answer and how you can use truth tables to find it.   You could probably reason through the cases by hand, but try making a truth table. Use two statements, being we are cousins and being we are both knaves .    Next you come upon three trolls, helpfully wearing name tags. They say:   Pat  If either Quinn or I are knights, then so is Ryan.    Quinn  Ryan is a knight and if Pat is a knight, then so am I.    Ryan  Quinn is a knave, but Pat and I share the same persuasion.   Create a truth table that includes all three statements. Then use the truth table to determine the persuasion of each troll.    Consider the statement about a party, If it's your birthday or there will be cake, then there will be cake.    Translate the above statement into symbols. Clearly state which statement is and which is .    Make a truth table for the statement.    Assuming the statement is true, what (if anything) can you conclude if there will be cake?    Assuming the statement is true, what (if anything) can you conclude if there will not be cake?    Suppose you found out that the statement was a lie. What can you conclude?         : it's your birthday; : there will be cake.    Hint: you should get three T's and one F.    Only that there will be cake.    It's NOT your birthday!    It's your birthday, but the cake is a lie.       Geoff Poshingten is out at a fancy pizza joint, and decides to order a calzone. When the waiter asks what he would like in it, he replies, I want either pepperoni or sausage. Also, if I have sausage, then I must also include quail. Oh, and if I have pepperoni or quail then I must also have ricotta cheese.    Translate Geoff's order into logical symbols.    The waiter knows that Geoff is either a liar or a truth-teller (so either everything he says is false, or everything is true). Which is it?    What, if anything, can the waiter conclude about the ingredients in Geoff's desired calzone?      You should write down three statements using the symbols . If Geoff is a truth-teller, then all three statements would be true. If he was a liar, then all three statements would be false. But in either case, we don't yet know whether the four atomic statements are true or false, since he hasn't said them by themselves.  A truth table might help, although is probably not entirely necessary.    Determine whether the following two statements are logically equivalent: and . Explain how you know you are correct.   Make a truth table for each and compare. The statements are logically equivalent.    Simplify the following statements (so that negation only appears right before variables).  .   .   .   It is false that if Sam is not a man then Chris is a woman, and that Chris is not a woman.        .   or, replacing the implication with a disjunction first: .    . This is necessarily false, so it is also equivalent to .    Either Sam is a woman and Chris is a man, or Chris is a woman.       Use De Morgan's Laws, and any other logical equivalence facts you know to simplify the following statements. Show all your steps. Your final statements should have negations only appear directly next to the sentence variables or predicates ( , , , etc.), and no double negations. It would be a good idea to use only conjunctions, disjunctions, and negations.   .   (careful with the implications).   For both parts above, verify your answers are correct using truth tables. That is, use a truth table to check that the given statement and your proposed simplification are actually logically equivalent.       Consider the statement, If a number is triangular or square, then it is not prime    Make a truth table for the statement .    If you believed the statement was false , what properties would a counterexample need to possess? Explain by referencing your truth table.    If the statement were true, what could you conclude about the number 5657, which is definitely prime? Again, explain using the truth table.         There will be three rows in which the statement is false.    Consider the three rows that evaluate to false and say what the truth values of , , and are there.    You are looking for a row in which is true, and the whole statement is true.       Tommy Flanagan was telling you what he ate yesterday afternoon. He tells you, I had either popcorn or raisins. Also, if I had cucumber sandwiches, then I had soda. But I didn't drink soda or tea. Of course you know that Tommy is the worlds worst liar, and everything he says is false. What did Tommy eat?  Justify your answer by writing all of Tommy's statements using sentence variables ( ), taking their negations, and using these to deduce what Tommy actually ate.   Write down three statements, and then take the negation of each (since he is a liar). You should find that Tommy ate one item and drank one item. ( is for cucumber sandwiches.)    Can you chain implications together? That is, if and , does that means the ? Can you chain more implications together? Let's find out:   Prove that the following is a valid deduction rule:                        Prove that the following is a valid deduction rule for any :                           .     I suggest you don't go through the trouble of writing out a row truth table. Instead, you should use part (a) and mathematical induction.      For the second part, you can inductively assume that from the first implications you can deduce . Then you are back in the case in part (a) again.    Suppose and are (possibly molecular) propositional statements. Prove that and are logically equivalent if any only if is a tautology.   What do these concepts mean in terms of truth tables?    Suppose and are (possibly molecular) propositional statements. Suppose further that                                is a valid deduction rule. Prove that the statement is a tautology.    "

  "body": " Quantifiers and Predicate Logic   Beyond Propositions   Consider the statements below. Decide whether any are equivalent to each other, or whether any imply any others.     You can fool some people all of the time.    You can fool everyone some of the time.    You can always fool some people.    Sometimes you can fool everyone.       After thinking about the Investigate! problem above, share your initial thoughts below.   We have been a little sloppy when describing statements. Consider, if a number is a multiple of 4, then it is even. This is a fantastic example of a true implication with a false converse (just because a number is even, doesn't mean it is a multiple of 4). However, the example isn't really a statement in the sense we have been using, since a number is some sort of variable.  Let's be a little more careful. To make the variable explicit, write the sentence this way:   If is a multiple of 4, then is even.   While the sentence is not a statement, it becomes a statement as soon as we substitute a number in for . Examples:   If 8 is a multiple of 4, then 8 is even.    If 14 is a multiple of 4, then 14 is even.   Both of these are statements, and both of them are true (the first because it is true implies true , the second because it is false implies true ). In fact, any number (integer) we substitute for will resolve to a true statement!  Let's just consider the first five natural numbers: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4. Each statement we get is an implication, and we can call the five if parts and the five then parts (luckily we are only talking about five statements). We then claim that all these implications are true, so we claim that this is true: . We can even make a truth table (with rows) to help us understand the statement.  Let's go wild and consider the first 25 natural numbers. With only twenty-six capital letters, we need another way to refer to the atomic statements. We will use subscripts: for the if parts and for the then parts. Now to claim that all these are true is to claim that the following is a true statement: . Of course, the dot-dot-dots here are not really part of logic, that is just short hand to say that I didn't want to type out all 25 implications.   A truth table for this statement would have rows, if each row occupied half a centimeter, would stretch almost 3.5 trillion miles, which would stretch from the earth to the sum roughly 380,000 times.   What we really want, though, is to take the conjunction ( and ) of the infinitely many statements where we replace with each of the infinitely many integers. Not only is this impractical, it is also illegal : a molecular statement must be made up of a finite number of atoms in our construction of symbolic logic.  There must be a better way! What we want is to claim that for all numbers , the implication is true. So let's say this. We even introduce a new symbol to deal with the quantifier , for all .    The universal quantifier is written and read, for all.     Our statement above can then be written as, . That seems much nicer than writing out infinitely many implications.  While we are at it, let's consider a way to work with arbitrarily many disjunctions ( or statements). Remember that a disjunction is true precisely when at least one of the parts are true. For example, we might claim that the statement, is prime and is even, is true for at least one value of . Maybe use for is prime and for is odd Instead of writing, (which is not allowed, because statements must be finite), we should write, .    The existential quantifier is written and is read, there exists.     Our goal in this section is to understand statements that involve these two quantifiers and learn how they interact with the logical connectives from propositional logic studied in .     After completing this section, you should be able to do the following.     Identify the logical form of statements involving quantifiers and write them out in symbols.    Simplify statements involving quantifiers and logical connectives, including negation.    Justify why a statement involving quantifiers is true or false by considering the domain of discourse.      Preview Activity   Before reading on to the main content of the section, complete this preview activity to start thinking about the types of questions this section will address.    Let be the predicate, person can be fooled at time .   Match each statement with it's representation in symbols.    Some people can be fooled all of the time.     Everyone can be fooled sometimes.     It is always true that some people can be fooled.     Sometimes everyone can be fooled.      Your friend believes that in fact you cannot fool everyone at the same time. What is another way of saying this, and how would you write that in symbols (using to say you can fool at time ).     Someone is never fooled.       Everyone is never fooled.       Someone is not fooled sometimes.       Everyone is not fooled sometimes.       Regardless of your beliefs of how many people can be fooled at various times, what could you conclude if we reinterpret to mean and only quantify over the natural numbers (so means for all natural numbers and means there exists a natural number )? Select all of the following that apply.      is true.       is true.    Careful, means is less than , not is less than or equal to .       is true.       is true.      No matter what means, we can conclude that and are NOT logically equivalent         Statements with variables   free variable  predicate Suppose we wanted to claim that if is prime, then is not prime. This looks like an implication. I would like to write something like where means  is prime. We could have also written , but using parentheses is a little more common, and suggests that we can substitute values for , just like we substitute values in functions. The variable in a sentence like this is called a free variable . It is a variable that we have not specified anything about. A sentence that contains variables is called a predicate .  As we have seen, when we substitute a value for , we get a statement. is a statement, and therefore is a statement, which happens to be true. In fact, it turns out that no matter what value we plug in for , we get a true implication in this case. Thus we claim that the following is a true statement. . By the way, once we quantify the , we say that the variable is no longer free , but rather is a bound variable (it is bound by the quantifier). Since there are no free variables any more, the sentence really is a statement.  Although there are many types of quantifiers in English (e.g., many, few, most, etc.) in mathematics we, for the most part, stick to two: existential and universal. Here is a summary of these two together.   Universal and Existential Quantifiers  quantifier  The existential quantifier is and is read there exists or there is.   For example, existential quantifier  quantifier there exists  there exists (quantifier)    existential quantifier   asserts that there is a number less than 0.  The universal quantifier is and is read for all or every.   For example, universal quantifier  quantifier for all  for all (quantifier)    universal quantifier   asserts that every number is greater than or equal to 0.   As with all mathematical statements, we would like to decide whether quantified statements are true or false. Consider the statement . You would read this, for every there is some such that is less than . Is this true? The answer depends on what our domain of discourse is: when we say for all  , do we mean all positive integers or all real numbers or all elements of some other set? Usually this information is implied. In discrete mathematics, we almost always quantify over the natural numbers , 0, 1, 2, , so let's take that for our domain of discourse here.  For the statement to be true, we need it to be the case that no matter what natural number we select, there is always some natural number that is strictly smaller. Perhaps we could let be ? But here is the problem: what if ? Then and that is not a number! (in our domain of discourse). Thus we see that the statement is false because there is a number which is less than or equal to all other numbers. In symbols, .  To show that the original statement is false, we proved that the negation was true. Notice how the negation and original statement compare. This is typical.   Quantifiers and Negation  quantifier interaction with negation  negation interaction with quantifiers    is equivalent to .   is equivalent to .    Essentially, we can pass the negation symbol over a quantifier, but that causes the quantifier to switch type. This should not be surprising: if not everything has a property, then something doesn't have that property. And if there is not something with a property, then everything doesn't have that property.  Another way to see why this makes sense: universal quantifiers are like (possibly infinite) conjunctions, and existential quantifiers are like (possibly infinite) disjunctions. De Morgan's laws tells us that when we negate a conjunction, we get a disjunction, and when we negate a disjunction, we get a conjunction. Isn't it great when everything works out as it should?    Suppose we claim that there is no smallest number. We can translate this into symbols as (literally, it is not true that there is a number such that for all numbers , is less than or equal to ).  However, we know how negation interacts with quantifiers: we can pass a negation over a quantifier by switching the quantifier type (between universal and existential). So the statement above should be logically equivalent to . Notice that is the negation of . This literally says, for every number there is a number which is smaller than . We see that this is another way to make our original claim.    It is important to stress that predicate logic extends propositional logic (much in the way quantum mechanics extends classical mechanics). Everything that we learned about logical equivalence and deductions still applies. However, predicate logic allows us to analyze statements at a higher resolution, digging down into the individual propositions , , etc.  To do this, we need to understand how quantifiers and connectives interact. We have already seen something about negations and quantifiers. What about the other connectives? Let's look at an example exploring how the universal quantifier and disjunctions can (or cannot) work together.        Consider the two statements, . Are these logically equivalent?    These statements are NOT logically equivalent. Intuitively, the statement on the left is claiming that everything is either a -thing or a -thing. The statement on the right is claiming either everything is a -thing or that everything is a -thing. These feel different.  To be sure, we would like to think of predicates and and some domain of discourse such that one of the statements is true and the other is false. How about we let be, is even and be is odd. Our domain of discourse will be all integers (as that is the set of numbers for which even and odd make sense).  The statement on the left is true! Every number is either even or odd. But is every number even? No. Is every number odd? No. So the statement on the right is false (it is a false or false ).  Interestingly, the statement on the right implies the statement on the left. That is, is always true. This is sort of like a tautology, although we reserve that term for necessary truths in propositional logic. A statement in predicate logic that is necessarily true gets the more prestigious designation of a law of logic  law of logic (or sometimes logically valid , logically valid law of logic  but that is less fun).   We can also consider how quantifiers interact with each other.    Can you switch the order of quantifiers? For example, consider the two statements: . Are these logically equivalent?    These statements are NOT logically equivalent. To see this, we should provide an interpretation of the predicate which makes one of the statements true and the other false.  Let be the predicate . It is true, in the natural numbers, that for all there is some greater than that (since there are infinitely many numbers). However, there is not a natural number which is greater than every number . Thus it is possible for to be true while is false.  We cannot do the reverse of this though. If there is some for which every satisfies , then certainly for every there is some which satisfies . The first is saying we can find one that works for every . The second allows different 's to work for different 's, but there is nothing preventing us from using the same that work for every . In other words, while we don't have logical equivalence between the two statements, we do have a valid deduction rule:                 Put yet another way, this says that the single statement is always true; it is a law of logic.    A full treatment of predicate logic is beyond the scope of this text. One reason is that there is no systematic procedure for deciding whether two statements in predicate logic are logically equivalent (i.e., there is no analogue to truth tables here).   Implicit Quantifiers  implicit quantifier  quantifier implicit  It is always a good idea to be precise in mathematics. Sometimes though, we can relax a little bit, as long as we all agree on a convention. An example of such a convention is to assume that sentences containing predicates with free variables are intended as statements, where the variables are universally quantified.  For example, do you believe that if a shape is a square, then it is a rectangle? But how can that be true if it is not a statement? To be a little more precise, we have two predicates: standing for is a square and standing for is a rectangle . The sentence we are looking at is, . This is neither true nor false, as it is not a statement. But come on! We all know that we meant to consider the statement, , and this is what our convention tells us to consider. When we add enough universal quantifiers to the beginning of a sentence so that all free variables become bound, we call the resulting statement the universal generalization of the original sentence.  Similarly, we will often be a bit sloppy about the distinction between a predicate and a statement. For example, we might write, let be the statement , is prime, which is technically incorrect. It is implicit that we mean that we are defining to be a predicate, which for each becomes the statement, is prime.       Consider the sentence, . What can we say about this sentence? Select all that apply.     The sentence is a statement because it contains quantifiers.      The sentence is not a statement because and are free variables.      The sentence is not a statement because is a free variable.      The universal generalization of the sentence is a statement.      Which of the following statements is a law of logic ?      .       .       .       .      What questions do you have after reading this section? Write at least one question about the content of this section that you are curious about.     Practice Problems     Let be the predicate, is even.    Is true or false?   True    False    Neither (not a statement)      What, if anything, can you conclude about from the truth value of    must be true.    must be false.    could be true or could be false.

In this case, happens to be true (since is true, for example).        binary predicate   predicate  binary    Suppose is some binary predicate defined on a very small domain of discourse: just the integers 1, 2, 3, and 4. For each of the 16 pairs of these numbers, is either true or false, according to the following table ( values are rows, values are columns).           1  2  3  4    1  T  F  F  F    2  F  T  T  F    3  T  T  T  T    4  F  F  F  F    For example, is false, as indicated by the F in the first row, third column.  Use the table to decide whether the following statements are true or false.                       Additional Exercises    For a given predicate , you might believe that the statements or are either true or false. How would you decide if you were correct in each case? You have four choices: you could give an example of an element in the domain for which is true or for which if false, or you could argue that no matter what is, is true or is false.   What would you need to do to prove is true?    What would you need to do to prove is false?    What would you need to do to prove is true?    What would you need to do to prove is false?         The claim that means that is true no matter what you consider in the domain of discourse. Thus the only way to prove that is true is to check or otherwise argue that is true for all in the domain.    To prove is false all you need is one example of an element in the domain for which is false. This is often called a counterexample .    We are simply claiming that there is some element in the domain of discourse for which is true. If you can find one such element, you have verified the claim.    Here we are claiming that no element we find will make true. The only way to be sure of this is to verify that every element of the domain makes false. Note that the level of proof needed for this statement is the same as to prove that is true.       Translate into symbols. Use for is even and for is odd.    No number is both even and odd.    One more than any even number is an odd number.    There is prime number that is even.    Between any two numbers there is a third number.    There is no number between a number and one more than that number.        .  .   (where means is prime ).   .  .      Translate into English:  .  .  .  .        Any even number plus 2 is an even number.    For any there is a such that . In other words, every number is in the domain of sine.    For every there is an such that . In other words, every number is in the range of sine (which is false).    For any numbers, if the cubes of two numbers are equal, then the numbers are equal.       Suppose is some predicate for which the statement is true. Is it also the case that is true? In other words, is the statement always true? Is the converse always true? Assume the domain of discourse is non-empty.   Try an example. What if was the predicate, is prime ? What if it was if is divisible by 4, then it is even ? Of course examples are not enough to prove something in general, but that is entirely the point of this question.    For each of the statements below, give a domain of discourse for which the statement is true, and a domain for which the statement is false.  .   .   .     First figure out what each statement is saying. For part (c), you don't need to assume the domain is an infinite set.    Simplifying negations will be especially useful when we try to prove a statement by considering what would happen if it were false. For each statement below, write the negation of the statement as simply as possible. Don't just say, it is false that    Every number is either even or odd.    There is a sequence that is both arithmetic and geometric.    For all numbers , if is prime, then is not prime.      It might help to translate the statements into symbols and then use the formulaic rules to simplify negations (i.e., rules for quantifiers and De Morgan's laws). After simplifying, you should get , for the first one, for example. Then translate this back into English.    We can simplify statements in predicate logic using our rules for passing negations over quantifiers, and then applying propositional logical equivalence to the inside propositional part. Simplify the statements below (so negation appears only directly next to predicates).   .   .   There is a number for which no other number is either less than or equal to .    It is false that for every number there are two other numbers which is between.         .   .   There is a number for which every other number is strictly greater than .    There is a number which is not between any other two numbers.       Simplify the statements below to the point that negation symbols occur only directly next to predicates.    .     .        solitary number   Consider the statement, For all natural numbers , if is prime, then is solitary. You do not need to know what solitary means for this problem, just that it is a property that some numbers have and others do not.   Write the converse and the contrapositive of the statement, saying which is which. Note: the original statement claims that an implication is true for all , and it is that implication that we are taking the converse and contrapositive of.    Write the negation of the original statement. What would you need to show to prove that the statement is false?    Even though you don't know whether 10 is solitary (in fact, nobody knows this), is the statement if 10 is prime, then 10 is solitary true or false? Explain.    It turns out that 8 is solitary. Does this tell you anything about the truth or falsity of the original statement, its converse or its contrapositive? Explain.    Assuming that the original statement is true, what can you say about the relationship between the set  of prime numbers and the set  of solitary numbers. Explain.        "

Suppose that is even but and are both odd. Namely, , and for some integers , , and . Then .  But since is an integer, this says that the integer is equal to a non-integer, which is impossible.    Let be an even number, say , and be an odd number, say . .  Therefore must be even.       After reading the Investigate! activity above, which of the four proofs do you think are valid? Which do you think are valid proofs of the statement they claim to prove? Briefly explain your thinking.   Anyone who doesn't believe there is creativity in mathematics clearly has not tried to write proofs. Finding a way to convince the world that a particular statement is necessarily true is a mighty undertaking and can often be quite challenging. There is not a guaranteed path to success in the search for proofs. For example, in the summer of 1742, a German mathematician by the name of Christian Goldbach wondered whether every even integer greater than 2 could be written as the sum of two primes. Centuries later, we still don't have a proof of this apparent fact (computers have checked that Goldbach's Conjecture holds for all numbers less than , which leaves only infinitely many more numbers to check).  Writing proofs is a bit of an art. Like any art, to be truly great at it, you need some sort of inspiration, as well as some foundational technique. Just as musicians can learn proper fingering, and painters can learn the proper way to hold a brush, we can look at the proper way to construct arguments. A good place to start might be to study a classic.    There are infinitely many primes.  prime numbers       Suppose this were not the case. That is, suppose there are only finitely many primes. Then there must be a last, largest prime, call it . Consider the number .  Now is certainly larger than . Also, is not divisible by any number less than or equal to , since every number less than or equal to divides . Thus the prime factorization of contains prime numbers (possibly just itself) all greater than . So is not the largest prime, a contradiction. Therefore there are infinitely many primes.   This proof is an example of a proof by contradiction , one of the standard styles of mathematical proof. First and foremost, the proof is an argument. It contains sequence of statements, the last being the conclusion which follows from the previous statements. The argument is valid so the conclusion must be true if the premises are true. Let's go through the proof line by line.     Suppose there are only finitely many primes. [this is a premise. Note the use of suppose. ]     There must be a largest prime, call it . [follows from line 1, by the definition of finitely many. ]     Let . [basically just notation, although this is the inspired part of the proof; looking at is the key insight.]     is larger than . [by the definition of ]    is not divisible by any number less than or equal to . [by definition, is divisible by each number less than or equal to , so is not.]    The prime factorization of contains prime numbers greater than . [since is divisible by each prime number in the prime factorization of , and by line 5.]     Therefore is not the largest prime. [by line 6, is divisible by a prime larger than .]     This is a contradiction. [from line 2 and line 7: the largest prime is and there is a prime larger than .]     Therefore there are infinitely many primes. [from line 1 and line 8: our only premise lead to a contradiction, so the premise is false.]      We should say a bit more about the last line. Up through line 8, we have a valid argument with the premise there are only finitely many primes and the conclusion there is a prime larger than the largest prime. This is a valid argument as each line follows from previous lines. So if the premises are true, then the conclusion must be true. However, the conclusion is NOT true. The only way out: the premise must be false.  The sort of line-by-line analysis we did above is a great way to really understand what is going on. Whenever you come across a proof in a textbook, you really should make sure you understand what each line is saying and why it is true.  Thinking about the proof as a whole, we can analyze the proof through two distinct but intersecting lenses. First, we can think about the logical structure of the proof. Recognizing the above proof as a proof by contradiction is an example of this. Second, we can look at the mathematical content of the proof. How does the proof illustrate understanding of mathematical concepts? Does it use definitions of mathematical objects correctly? How do the definitions interact with each other? Recall that in we said that a tautology is a necessarily true statement, but doesn't tell us anything interesting. Similarly, if a proof relied entirely on the logical form of the statement it was proving, it wouldn't tell us anything interesting about mathematics. Thus all the proofs we consider must involve some combining of mathematical concepts in addition to their logical structure.  In this section will will see examples of how the interaction between logical and mathematical structure plays out. We will think of the logical structure as the skeleton or scaffolding of the proof, and look at the different shapes this skeleton can take. We will then see how the mathematical content of the proof fills in the details of the skeleton; how it adds meat to the bones.    After completing this section, you should be able to do the following.     Identify the logical structure of, and distinguish between, direct proofs , a proof by contrapositives and a proof by contradictions .    Identify flaws in a incorrect proof and determine whether they are flaws in logic or mathematical concepts.    Apply definitions of mathematical objects to prove statements using basic proof styles.       Direct Proof   direct proof   The simplest (from a logic perspective) style of proof is a direct proof . Often all that is required to prove something is a systematic explanation of what everything means. You look at the definitions, carefully explain and unpack their meaning, until you see that the conclusion is true.  To see where to start a direct proof, it is useful to express the statement you are proving as an implication. The general format to prove is this:   Assume . Explain, explain, , explain. Therefore .   For example, if we wanted to prove that, all squares are rectangles, , first realize that this is the same as saying, for any shape, if the shape is a square, then it is a rectangle. In symbols, . Often we want to prove universal statements, perhaps of the form . Again, we will want to assume is true and deduce . But what about the ? We want this to work for all  . We accomplish this by fixing to be an arbitrary element (of the sort we are interested in).  Here are a few examples. First, we will set up the proof structure for a direct proof, then fill in the details.    Prove: For all integers , if is even, then is even.    The format of the proof will be this: Let be an arbitrary integer. Assume that is even. Explain explain explain. Therefore is even.  To fill in the details, we explain what it means for to be even, and then see what that means for . The definition that is relevant here is, an integer is even if there is an integer such that . Here is a complete proof.   Let be an arbitrary integer. Suppose is even. Then for some integer . Now . Since is an integer, is even.       Prove: For all integers , , and , if and then . (Here , read divides means that is a multiple of , i.e., that will divide into without remainder).    Even before we know what the divides symbol means, we can set up a direct proof for this statement. It will go something like this: Let , , and be arbitrary integers. Assume that and . Dot dot dot. Therefore .  How do we connect the dots? We say what our hypothesis ( and ) really means and why this gives us what the conclusion ( ) really means. Another way to say that is to say that for some integer (that is, that is a multiple of ). What are we going for? That , for some integer (because we want to be a multiple of ). Here is the complete proof.   Let , , and be integers. Assume that and . In other words, is a multiple of and is a multiple of . So there are integers and such that and . Combining these (through substitution) we get that . But is an integer, so this says that is a multiple of . Therefore .       Proof by Contrapositive   contrapositive  proof by    proof  by contrapositive   Recall that an implication is logically equivalent to its contrapositive . There are plenty of examples of statements which are hard to prove directly, but whose contrapositive can easily be proved directly. This is all that proof by contrapositive does. It gives a direct proof of the contrapositive of the implication. This is enough because the contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original implication.  The skeleton of the proof of by contrapositive will always look roughly like this:   Assume . Explain, explain, explain. Therefore .   As before, if there are variables and quantifiers, we set them to be arbitrary elements of our domain. Here are two examples:    Is the statement for all integers , if is even, then is even true?    This is the converse of the statement we proved in above using a direct proof. From trying a few examples, this statement definitely appears to be true. So let's prove it.  A direct proof of this statement would require fixing an arbitrary and assuming that is even. But it is not at all clear how this would allow us to conclude anything about . Just because does not in itself suggest how we could write as a multiple of 2.  Try something else: write the contrapositive of the statement. We get, for all integers , if is odd then is odd. This looks much more promising.  We need a definition of a number being odd: an integer is odd provided for some integer . Our proof will look something like this:  Let be an arbitrary integer. Suppose that is not even. This means that . In other words . But this is the same as saying . Therefore is not even.  Now we fill in the details:   We will prove the contrapositive. Let be an arbitrary integer. Suppose that is not even, and thus odd. Then for some integer . Now . Since is an integer, we see that is odd and therefore not even.       Prove: for all integers and , if is odd, then is odd or is odd.    The problem with trying a direct proof is that it will be hard to separate and from knowing something about . On the other hand, if we know something about and separately, then combining them might give us information about . The contrapositive of the statement we are trying to prove is: for all integers and , if and are even, then is even. Thus our proof will have the following format:  Let and be integers. Assume that and are both even. la la la. Therefore is even.  Here is a complete proof:   Let and be integers. Assume that and are even. Then and for some integers and . Now . Since is an integer, we see that is even, completing the proof.   Note that our assumption that and are even is really the negation of or is odd. We used De Morgan's law here.    We have seen how to prove some statements in the form of implications: either directly or by contrapositive. Some statements are not written as implications to begin with.    Consider the following statement: for every prime number , either or is odd. We can rephrase this: for every prime number , if , then is odd. Now try to prove it.  Use this as the definition of a prime number: an integer is prime provided it has exactly two factors: and .     Let be an arbitrary prime number. Assume is not odd. So is divisible by 2. Since is prime, it must have exactly two divisors, and it has 2 as a divisor, so must be divisible by only 1 and 2. Therefore . This completes the proof (by contrapositive).       Proof by Contradiction   contradiction    proof  by contradiction    There might be statements which really cannot be rephrased as implications. For example, is irrational. In this case, it is hard to know where to start. What can we assume? Well, say we want to prove the statement . What if we could prove that where was false? If this implication is true, and is false, what can we say about ? It must be false as well, which makes true!  This is why proof by contradiction works. If we can prove that leads to a contradiction, then the only conclusion is that is false, so is true. That's what we wanted to prove. In other words, if it is impossible for to be false, must be true.  Here are three examples of proofs by contradiction:    Prove that is irrational.     Suppose not. Then is equal to a fraction . Without loss of generality, assume is in lowest terms (otherwise reduce the fraction). So,  .  Thus is even, and as such is even. So for some integer , and . We then have,  .  Thus is even, and as such is even. Since is also even, we see that is not in lowest terms, a contradiction. Thus is irrational.       Prove: There are no integers and such that .     We proceed by contradiction. So suppose there are integers and such that . So is even. We have seen that this implies that is even. So for some integer . Then . This in turn gives . But is even, and is odd, so these cannot be equal. Thus we have a contradiction, so there must not be any integers and such that .       The Pigeonhole Principle :  pigeonhole principle  If more than pigeons fly into pigeon holes, then at least one pigeon hole will contain at least two pigeons. Prove this!     Suppose, contrary to stipulation, that each of the pigeon holes contain at most one pigeon. Then at most, there will be pigeons. But we assumed that there are more than pigeons, so this is impossible. Thus there must be a pigeonhole with more than one pigeon.   While we phrased this proof as a proof by contradiction, we could have also used a proof by contrapositive since our contradiction was simply the negation of the hypothesis. Sometimes this will happen, in which case you can use either style of proof. There are examples however where the contradiction occurs far away from the original statement.      Proof by (counter) Example   counterexample   It is almost NEVER okay to prove a statement with just an example. Certainly none of the statements proved above can be proved through an example. This is because in each of those cases we are trying to prove that something holds of all integers. We claim that being even implies that is even, no matter what integer  we pick. Showing that this works for is not even close to enough.  This cannot be stressed enough. If you are trying to prove a statement of the form , you absolutely CANNOT prove this with an example. This is not to say that looking at examples is a waste of time. Doing so will often give you an idea of how to write a proof. But the examples do not belong in the proof.   However, existential statements can be proven this way. If we want to prove that there is an integer such that is not prime, all we need to do is find one. This might seem like a silly thing to want to prove until you try a few values for .        1  2  3  4  5  6  7       41  43  47  53  61  71  83     So far we have gotten only primes. You might be tempted to conjecture, For all positive integers , the number is prime. If you wanted to prove this, you would need to use a direct proof, a proof by contrapositive, or another style of proof, but certainly it is not enough to give even 7 examples. In fact, we can prove this conjecture is false by proving its negation: There is a positive integer such that is not prime. Since this is an existential statement, it suffices to show that there does indeed exist such a number.  In fact, we can quickly see that will give which is certainly not prime. You might say that this is a counterexample to the conjecture that is always prime. Since so many statements in mathematics are universal, making their negations existential, we can often prove that a statement is false (if it is) by providing a counterexample.    Above we proved, for all integers and , if is odd, then is odd or is odd. Is the converse true?    The converse is the statement, for all integers and , if is odd or is odd, then is odd. This is false! How do we prove it is false? We need to prove the negation of the converse. Let's look at the symbols. The converse is .  We want to prove the negation: .  Simplify using the rules from the previous sections: .  As the negation passed by the quantifiers, they changed from to . We then needed to take the negation of an implication, which is equivalent to asserting the if part and not the then part.  Now we know what to do. To prove that the converse is false we need to find two integers and so that is odd or is odd, but is not odd (so even). That's easy: 1 and 3. (remember, or means one or the other or both). Both of these are odd, but is not odd.      Proof by Cases   cases    proof  by cases   We could go on and on and on about different proof styles (we will discuss combinatorial proofs and proofs by induction in later sections), but instead we will end with one final useful technique: proof by cases. The idea is to prove that is true by proving that and for some statement . So no matter what, whether or not is true, we know that is true. In fact, we could generalize this. Suppose we want to prove . We know that at least one of the statements is true. If we can show that and and so on all the way to , then we can conclude . The key thing is that we want to be sure that one of our cases (the 's) must be true no matter what.  If that last paragraph was confusing, perhaps an example will make things better.    Prove: For any integer , the number is even.    It is hard to know where to start this, because we don't know much of anything about . We might be able to prove that is even if we knew that was even. In fact, we could probably prove that was even if was odd. But since must either be even or odd, this will be enough. Here's the proof.   We consider two cases: if is even or if is odd.   Case 1 : is even. Then for some integer . This give , and since is an integer, this says that is even.   Case 2 : is odd. Then for some integer . This gives , and since is an integer, we see that is even again.  Since is even in both exhaustive cases, we see that is indeed always even.

The converse is false. That is, there is an integer such that is even but is odd. For example, consider . Then which is even but is odd.       The game TENZI comes with 40 six-sided dice (each numbered 1 to 6). Suppose you roll all 40 dice.  Prove that there will be at least seven dice that land on the same number.   How many dice would you have to roll before you were guaranteed that some four of them would all match or all be different? Prove your answer.         This is an example of the pigeonhole principle. We can prove it by contrapositive.   Suppose that each number only came up 6 or fewer times. So there are at most six 1's, six 2's, and so on. That's a total of 36 dice, so you must not have rolled all 40 dice.     We can have 9 dice without any four matching or any four being all different: three 1's, three 2's, three 3's. We will prove that whenever you roll 10 dice, you will always get four matching or all being different.   Suppose you roll 10 dice, but that there are NOT four matching rolls. This means at most, there are three of any given value. If we only had three different values, that would be only 9 dice, so there must be 4 different values, giving 4 dice that are all different.        Prove that for all integers , it is the case that is even if and only if is even. That is, prove both implications: if is even, then is even, and if is even, then is even.   One of the implications will be a direct proof, the other will be a proof by contrapositive.    Prove that is irrational.   This is really an exercise in modifying the proof that is irrational. There you proved things were even; here they will be multiples of 3.    Consider the statement: for all integers and , if is even and is a multiple of 3, then is a multiple of 6.   Prove the statement. What sort of proof are you using?    State the converse. Is it true? Prove or disprove.      Part (a) should be a relatively easy direct proof. Look for a counterexample for part (b).    Prove the statement: For all integers , if is odd, then is odd. Clearly state the style of proof you are using.    Prove the statement: For all integers , , and , if , then or is even.   A proof by contradiction would be reasonable here, because then you get to assume that both  and  are odd. Deduce that is even, and therefore a multiple of 4 (why? and why is that a contradiction?).   prime numbers  Suppose that you would like to prove the following implication:   For all numbers , if is prime then is solitary.   Write out the beginning and end of the argument if you were to prove the statement,   Directly    By contrapositive    By contradiction     You do not need to provide details for the proofs (since you do not know what solitary means). However, make sure that you provide the first few and last few lines of the proofs so that we can see that logical structure you would follow.    Suppose you have a collection of rare 5-cent stamps and 8-cent stamps. You desperately need to mail a letter and having no other stamps available, decide to dip into your collection. The question is, what amounts of postage can you make?   Prove that if you only use an even number of both types of stamps, the amount of postage you make must be even.    Suppose you made an even amount of postage. Prove that you used an even number of at least one of the types of stamps.    Suppose you made exactly 72 cents of postage. Prove that you used at least 6 of at least one type of stamp.      Use a different style of proof for each part.    Prove: if and only if . Note, you will need to prove two directions here: the if and the only if part.    Prove that is irrational.   Note that if , then . Can any power of 7 be the same as a power of 10?    Prove that there are no integer solutions to the equation .   What if there were? Deduce that must be odd, and continue towards a contradiction.   prime numbers  Prove that every prime number greater than 3 is either one more or one less than a multiple of 6.

Of course we can do anything to one side of an equation as long as we also do it to the other side. So subtract 2 from both sides. This gives . Now square both sides, to get . And we all agree this is true.   What is going on here? Is your friend's argument valid? Is the argument a proof of the claim ? Carefully explain using what we know about logic.   Your friend's proof a proof, but of what? What implication follows from the given proof? Is that helpful?   playing cards  A standard deck of 52 cards consists of 4 suites (hearts, diamonds, spades and clubs) each containing 13 different values (Ace, 2, 3, , 10, J, Q, K). If you draw some number of cards at random you might or might not have a pair (two cards with the same value) or three cards all of the same suit. However, if you draw enough cards, you will be guaranteed to have these. For each of the following, find the smallest number of cards you would need to draw to be guaranteed having the specified cards. Prove your answers.   Three of a kind (for example, three 7's).    A flush of five cards (for example, five hearts).    Three cards that are either all the same suit or all different suits.       Suppose you are at a party with 19 of your closest friends (so including you, there are 20 people there). Explain why there must be least two people at the party who are friends with the same number of people at the party. Assume friendship is always reciprocated.   Consider the set of numbers of friends that everyone has. If everyone had a different number of friends, this set must contain 20 elements. Is that possible? Why not?   Doctor Who  Your friend has given you his list of 115 best Doctor Who episodes (in order of greatness). It turns out that you have seen 60 of them. Prove that there are at least two episodes you have seen that are exactly four episodes apart on your friend's list.   This feels like the pigeonhole principle, although a bit more complicated. At least, you could try to replicate the style of proof used by the pigeonhole principle. How would the episodes need to be spaced out so that no two of your sixty were exactly 4 apart?    chessboard  missing squares   Suppose you have an chessboard but your dog has eaten one of the corner squares. You have dominoes that each cover exactly two squares of the board. Can you cover the squares still remaining on the board with non-overlapping dominoes? What needs to be true about ? Give necessary and sufficient conditions (that is, say exactly which values of work and which do not work). Prove your answers.     An 8 by 8 chessboard with the top-right corner square removed. Every other square is shaded darker (checkerboard pattern).     chessboard missing squares  What if your chessboard is missing two opposite corners? Prove that no matter what is, you will not be able to cover the remaining squares with non-overlapping dominoes.     An 8 by 8 chessboard with the top-right and bottom-left corner squares removed. Every other square is shaded darker (checkerboard pattern).      "

  "body": " Proofs about Discrete Structures   Note, this section is under construction. Check back later for more content.    Introduction    Suppose there are 15 people at a party. Most people know each other already, but there are still some people who decide to shake hands. Is it possible for everyone at the party to shake hands with exactly three other people?    So far we have seen how the logical form of a statement we wish to prove can inform how the build the scaffolding of a proof. The proof structure can only get us so far though: to flesh out the proof skeleton requires understanding of the mathematical objects and structures the proofs are about. Some of this can come from carefully reading definitions. Yet there is also some less concrete understanding and intuition that comes from working with the objects and structures that can lead to that ah-ha! moment of inspiration that suggests how to proceed with a proof.   Why are we writing proofs? Besides practice for becoming better reasoners, diving into careful proofs about discrete structures is a way to learn more about the structures themselves. They are a playground for exploring mathematics, to help us build intuition for mathematical structures. So we study structures to help us write proofs about them, and we write proofs about them to help understand the structures. Bootstrapping!   Another reason to shift our focus toward proofs about discrete structures is that doing so illustrates an important feature of mathematics: abstraction. We have been proving particular facts about particular problems. We might even start to notice similarities about the proofs of some solutions. This very well could be due to the underlying mathematical structures that the problems are (secretly) about. If we prove the general facts about these structures, then we can apply these theorems to many different problems.  Some discrete structures lend themselves to particular styles of proof and there are some standard proof techniques that apply to particular structures. We will see some of this here, but mostly we take this opportunity to remind ourselves of some of the basic definitions and properties for discrete structures, and use the proofs about them to help understand these better.    Proofs about sets  Recall that a set is an unordered collection of elements. We can describe a set by listing these elements, or by specifying a property that elements in the set all satisfy. For example, , or . The second set here is the set of natural numbers ( ) less than 10. Notice that every element in is also an element of . Here is a definition that captures that idea.    A set is a subset of a set , written , provided every element of is also an element of .  We say is a proper subset of , written , provided and . In other words, if every element of is an element in , and there is at least one element in that is not in .      Let and . Is ? Is a proper subset of ?    We are asking whether every natural number less than 5 is also a natural number whose square is less than 10. Okay, we could just write out the elements of the sets: and (since and ). So . But , so in fact .    The sets in the example above were small and easy enough to write down the elements of the sets. However, we can also prove subset relationships between sets if this isn't practical or even possible (perhaps the sets are infinite). Let's look carefully at how we could have reasoned about the example above.  We claimed that every element of was also an element of . Another way to say this: for all numbers , if  is an element of , then  is also an element of . Recognizing this as a conditional statement, we can proceed to give a direct, contrapositive, or contradiction proof of the fact. Here a direct proof would be perfectly acceptable. Let's try it:   Let be an element of the set . Then , by the definition of . Since , we must have that . By the definition of , and the fact that , we see that .   To be clear, this proof is way more than we would normally do for this example, but its format should be illuminating. Proving that one set is a subset of another is really the same as proving an implication!  To give an example of how we can apply the definition of subset in a more general setting, let's prove a basic fact about subsets.    For any sets , , and , if and , then .    We will give a direct proof. Let , , and be sets, and assume that and . We will prove that .  Let be an element of . Since , we know that . Since , we know that . Therefore, .    Let's now prove this fact about numbers: every multiple of 9100 is also a multiple of 13. We could factor 9100, but here is an easier way. The set of multiples of 9100 is a subset of the set of multiples of 91. And the set of multiples of 91 is a subset of the set of multiples of 13. Now apply the proposition above.    Proofs about functions  A function is a rule that assigns each element of the set (the domain) to exactly one element of the set (the codomain). It is any rule: there doesn't have to be a formula or rational for it, we just need to match up elements from to elements in . For example, we could let be the set of students enrolled in a particular Discrete Math course and let be the set of months of the year. Now define the function to be the rule that assigns to each student the month in which their birthday falls. Since every student has an assigned month, and no more than one month, this is a function.  Here is a definition of a particular type of function.    A function is injective (or one-to-one ) provided every element in is the image of at most one element in . In other words, no element in is the output for more than one input from .    In the example below, we use two-line notation to describe a function. The top row are the inputs, and the bottom row are the corresponding outputs. So might be defined as, , which means that , , , and .    Let and . Consider the functions and defined by, Which of these functions is injective?    The function is injective: each element of is the image of at most one element of . The function is not injective: the element 4 in is the image of both 1 and 3 in .    Consider the student to birth month function again. Could this possibly injective? Or put another way, must there be two students in the course with the same birth month (which would say the function is not injective)? The answer seems to depend on how many students are in the class.  But let's pause and think about the more general fact about functions we have here. Let's prove the following fact. Recall that denotes the cardinality (size) of the set : the number of elements in .    Suppose is a function with and both finite sets. If , then is not injective.    We will give a proof of the contrapositive: if is injective, then . Let . Since is injective, each element of must be the output for at most one element of . Thus there at most elements in that get mapped to by . But the definition of a function requires that every element of the domain is mapped to exactly one element of the codomain, so there must be at most elements in .    Does this proof remind you of our pigeonhole-like proofs? It should, since this is precisely (one of) the carful formulations of the pigeonhole principle. We could definitely have proved the fact about students sharing a birth month, but now we can just apply the proposition above and be done. When you apply a theorem or proposition to get directly prove another result, we call the latter result a corollary .    Suppose a class has 25 students. Then at least two students share the same birth month.    Consider the function that maps each student to their birth month. Since the domain has 25 elements and the codomain has 12 elements, the function is not injective, by . Therefore, at least two students share the same birth month.      Proofs about relations  A relation on a set is a set of ordered pairs of elements from . We can think of a relation as a way to describe a type of relationship between elements of . For example, we might have a relation on the set of people at a party that describes who is friends with whom. We might have a relation on the set of natural numbers that describes which pairs of numbers are related by the relation .  Relations permeate all of mathematics, often without us even thinking of them. Whenever you make a statement about two elements of set, you are implicitly defining a relation. The statement is true when the pair is in the relation. For example, the statement 3 is less than 5 is true because the pair is in the relation . In fact, using the language we developed in , we can now say that a relation is just a predicate, where the variables come from the same set.  Often relations have special symbols like or or . When we talk about a general relation, we will either use and write , or use a capital letter like , and write or or even (these all mean the same thing).  When we study relations, we try to identify properties that relations might have. Here is an example of a very common property.    A relation on a set is transitive provided for all , if and , then .      Consider the relation on the set of students in your Discrete Math course that holds of two students provided they have some other class together. Is this relation transitive?    No, not necessarily (although for some sets of students it could be). For example, suppose Alice has another class with Bruce, say Introduction to Programming. Carlos is not in Intro to Programming, but he and Bruce are both in Organic Chemistry. So then Alice Bruce and Bruce Carlos, but it might not be the case that Alice Carlos (since Alice need not be in Organic Chemistry with Carlos).      Proofs about graphs  We will spend all of studying proofs about graphs, since this is such a rich area of mathematics. As a preview, here is an example of how graph proofs can go.  A graph is a set of vertices and a set of edges . The edges are two-element subsets of the vertices, and we can think of them as representing relationships between the vertices. Note this is an abstract definition of a graph using sets, but we often draw graphs using dots for the vertices connected by lines for the edges, as this gives us a nice picture of what is going on.  Since graphs represent a type of relationship between elements (vertices), we can use graphs to represent many real world problems. For example, the vertices of a graph might represent people at a party. Each edge can represent a handshake between two people. So if we wondered whether it is possible for the 15 people at a party to each shake hands with exactly 3 people there, we are really asking whether there is a graph with 15 vertices where each vertex belongs to 3 edges. ( Belongs to ?? Yes, because an edges is two-element subset of the vertices, so if an edge touches or comes out of a vertex, that means the vertex belongs to that particular two-element subset.)  Here is a definition related to this idea.    Let be a vertex in a graph . The degree of , written , is the number of edges that contain , i.e., the number of edges incident to .      Consider the graph with vertices and edges . What is the degree of each vertex in ?    It might be helpful to picture the graph:   A graph with four vertices labeled 1 through 4. There are edges from vertex 1 to each of the other vertices, and an edge between vertices 2 and 3.    We have , , , and . You can see this by counting how many edges are incident to each vertex, or by counting how many edge-subsets each vertex belongs to.    So is it possible for among 15 people for everyone to shake hands with exactly three people? Well, is there a graph with 15 vertices, all of degree 3? The answer is no!  One way you can see this is if you ask how many edges such a graph would have. Each vertex is incident to three edges, so counting incidences, we get . But every edge is incident to two vertices, so we have counted each edge twice. So the number of edges in such a graph would be . But the number of edges in a graph must be a whole number, so there is no such graph.  This suggests that we can say something more in general. The following proposition is a simple consequence of the Handshake Lemma , which we will prove in . Here we give a complete proof of this particular formulation of it.    In any graph, the number of vertices with odd degree must be even.    We will prove this by contradiction. Suppose there was a graph with and odd number of vertices with odd degree. If we take the sum of all the degrees of all the vertices, then the sum of the degrees of odd degree vertices would be odd (since the sum of an odd number of odd numbers is odd). The sum of all the even-degree vertices will be even (any sum of even numbers must be even). The sum of an odd number and an even number is odd. Thus the sum of all the degrees will be odd.  However, the number of edges in a graph is half the sum of the degrees (by , or simply because each edge contributes one to the count of the degree of two vertices). Since the number of edges is a whole number, we see that the sum of the degrees must be even. This contradicts what we found in the previous paragraph.  Therefore, in any graph, the number of vertices with odd degree must be even.     "

  "body": " Chapter Summary   We have considered logic both as its own sub-discipline of mathematics, and as a means to help us better understand and write proofs. In either view, we noticed that mathematical statements have a particular logical form, and analyzing that form can help make sense of the statement.  At the most basic level, a statement might combine simpler statements using logical connectives . We often make use of variables, and quantify over those variables. How to resolve the truth or falsity of a statement based on these connectives and quantifiers is what logic is all about. From this, we can decide whether two statements are logically equivalent or if one or more statements (logically) imply another.  When writing proofs (in any area of mathematics) our goal is to explain why a mathematical statement is true. Thus it is vital that our argument implies the truth of the statement. To be sure of this, we first must know what it means for the statement to be true, as well as ensure that the statements that make up the proof correctly imply the conclusion. A firm understanding of logic is required to check whether a proof is correct.  There is, however, another reason that understanding logic can be helpful. Understanding the logical structure of a statement often gives clues as how to write a proof of the statement.  This is not to say that writing proofs is always straight forward. Consider again the Goldbach conjecture : Goldbach conjecture    Every even number greater than 2 can be written as the sum of two primes.   We are not going to try to prove the statement here, but we can at least say what a proof might look like, based on the logical form of the statement. Perhaps we should write the statement in an equivalent way which better highlights the quantifiers and connectives:   For all integers , if is even and greater than 2, then there exists integers and such that and are prime and .   What would a direct proof look like? Since the statement starts with a universal quantifier, we would start by, ``Let be an arbitrary integer.\" The rest of the statement is an implication. In a direct proof we assume the if part, so the next line would be, Assume is greater than 2 and is even. I have no idea what comes next, but eventually, we would need to find two prime numbers and (depending on ) and explain how we know that .  Or maybe we try a proof by contradiction. To do this, we first assume the negation of the statement we want to prove. What is the negation? From what we have studied we should be able to see that it is,   There is an integer such that is even and greater than , but for all integers and , either or is not prime or .   Could this statement be true? A proof by contradiction would start by assuming it was and eventually conclude with a contradiction, proving that our assumption of truth was incorrect. And if you can find such a contradiction, you will have proved the most famous open problem in mathematics. Good luck.    Chapter Review   Complete a truth table for the statement .

Write the negation of the statement, both in words and in symbols. Is the negation true?         For any number , if it is the case that adding any number to gives that number back, then multiplying any number by will give 0. This is true (of the integers or the reals). The if part only holds if , and in that case, anything times will be 0.    The converse in words is this: for any number , if everything times is zero, then everything added to gives itself. Or in symbols: . The converse is true: the only number which when multiplied by any other number gives 0 is . And if , then .    The contrapositive in words is: for any number , if there is some number which when multiplied by does not give zero, then there is some number which when added to does not give that number. In symbols: . We know the contrapositive must be true because the original implication is true.    The negation: there is a number such that any number added to gives the number back again, but there is a number you can multiply by and not get 0. In symbols: . Of course since the original implication is true, the negation is false.       Simplify the following.   .   .        .   .      Consider the statement: for all integers , if is odd, then is odd.

Since is an integer, we see that is odd.      The converse is: for all integers , if is odd, then is odd. We will prove this by contrapositive.  Let be an integer. Assume is not odd. Then for some integer . So which is to say is even. Therefore is not odd.         Suppose you break your piggy bank and scoop up a handful of 22 coins (pennies, nickels, dimes and quarters).   Prove that you must have at least 6 coins of a single denomination.    Suppose you have an odd number of pennies. Prove that you must have an odd number of at least one of the other types of coins.    How many coins would you need to scoop up to be sure that you either had 4 coins that were all the same or 4 coins that were all different? Prove your answer.         Suppose you only had 5 coins of each denomination. This means you have 5 pennies, 5 nickels, 5 dimes and 5 quarters. This is a total of 20 coins. But you have more than 20 coins, so you must have more than 5 of at least one type.    Suppose you have 22 coins, including nickels, dimes, and quarters (so an even number of each of these three types of coins). The number of pennies you have will then be . But this says that the number of pennies is also even (it is 2 times an integer). Thus we have established the contrapositive of the statement, If you have an odd number of pennies then you have an odd number of at least one other coin type.     You need 10 coins. You could have 3 pennies, 3 nickels, and 3 dimes. The 10th coin must either be a quarter, giving you 4 coins that are all different, or else a 4th penny, nickel or dime. To prove this, assume you don't have 4 coins that are all the same or all different. In particular, this says that you only have 3 coin types, and each of those types can only contain 3 coins, for a total of 9 coins, which is less than 10.      knights and knaves puzzle knights and knaves  You come across four trolls playing bridge. They declare:   Troll 1: All trolls here see at least one knave.  Troll 2: I see at least one troll that sees only knaves.  Troll 3: Some trolls are scared of goats.  Troll 4: All trolls are scared of goats.   Are there any trolls that are not scared of goats? Recall, of course, that all trolls are either knights (who always tell the truth) or knaves (who always lie).    "

The top vertices are labeled b, d, f from left to right. The bottom vertices are labeled a, c, e from left to right. Three edges connect each vertex in the top row to the vertex below it. Four more edges cross from a top vertex to a bottom vertex just to the left or right (forming two X's).     A graph with six vertices arranged in two rows of three. The top vertices are labeled b, c, f from left to right. The bottom vertices are labeled a, d, e from left to right. Three edges connect each vertex in the top row to the vertex below it. Four more edges connect vertices along the top row and along the bottom row. Together this looks like two adjacent squares.     A graph with six vertices arranged in two rows of three. The top vertices are labeled c, b, f from left to right. The bottom vertices are labeled a, e, d from left to right. Three edges connect each vertex in the top row to the vertex below it. Four more edges cross from a top vertex to a bottom vertex just to the left or right (forming two X's).     A graph with six vertices arranged in two rows of three. The top vertices are labeled v1, v2, v3 from left to right. The bottom vertices are labeled b6, v5, v4 from left to right. Three edges connect each vertex in the top row to the vertex below it. Four more edges connect vertices along the top row and along the bottom row. Together this looks like two adjacent squares.    Actually, all the graphs we have seen above are just drawings of graphs. A graph is really an abstract mathematical object consisting of two sets and where is a set of 2-element subsets of . Are the graphs below the same or different?   Graph 1:   ,   .    Graph 2:   ,   .      Before we start studying graphs, we need to agree upon what a graph is. While we almost always think of graphs as pictures (dots connected by lines) this is fairly ambiguous. Do the lines need to be straight? Does it matter how long the lines are or how large the dots are? Can there be two lines connecting the same pair of dots? Can one line connect three dots?  The way we avoid ambiguities in mathematics is to provide concrete and rigorous definitions . Crafting good definitions is not easy, but it is incredibly important. The definition is the agreed upon starting point from which all truths in mathematics proceed. Is there a graph with no edges? We have to look at the definition to see if this is possible.  We want our definition to be precise and unambiguous, but it also must agree with our intuition for the objects we are studying. It needs to be useful: we could define a graph to be a six legged mammal, but that would not let us solve any problems about bridges. Instead, here is the (now) standard definition of a graph.   Graph Definition  graph   graph vertex   graph edge   vertex   edge   A graph is an ordered pair consisting of a nonempty set (called the vertices ) and a set (called the edges ) of two-element subsets of .   Strange. Nowhere in the definition is there talk of dots or lines. From the definition, a graph could be . Here we have a graph with four vertices (the letters ) and five edges (the pairs ).   graph drawing  Looking at sets and sets of 2-element sets is difficult to process. That is why we often draw a representation of these sets. We put a dot down for each vertex, and connect two dots with a line precisely when those two vertices are one of the 2-element subsets in our set of edges. Thus one way to draw the graph described above is this:    Four vertices arranged in a square, with edges on the border of the square and one connecting the bottom left vertex to the top right vertex. Vertices are labeled a (top left), b (top right), c (bottom left) and d (bottom right).   However we could also have drawn the graph differently. For example either of these:     Four vertices arranged in a square. Vertices are labeled a (top left), d (top right), c (bottom left) and b (bottom right). Edges connect a to c and b, d to b and c, and c to b.      Four vertices arranged in a horizontal row, labeled a, b, c, and d from left to right. Edges connect each vertex to the one on its right. A curved edge connects a to c, and another curved edge connects b to d.    We should be careful about what it means for two graphs to be the same. Actually, given our definition, this is easy: Are the vertex sets equal? Are the edge sets equal? We know what it means for sets to be equal, and graphs are nothing but a pair of two special sorts of sets.   equality of graphs   graph equality    Are the graphs below equal? .    No. Here the vertex sets of each graph are equal, which is a good start. Also, both graphs have two edges. In the first graph, we have edges and , while in the second graph we have edges and . Now we do have , so that is not the problem. The issue is that . Since the edge sets of the two graphs are not equal (as sets), the graphs are not equal (as graphs).    Even if two graphs are not equal , they might be basically the same. The graphs in the previous example could be drawn like this:    Two graphs with three vertices each arranged in a horizontal row. Edges connect vertices to the vertex on either side of it. The graph on the left (G1) has vertices labeled a, b, c from left to right. The graph on the right (G2) has vertices labeled a, c, b from left to right.   Graphs that are basically the same (but perhaps not equal) are called isomorphic . We will give a precise definition of this term after a quick example:    Consider the graphs:    Are these graphs the same?    The two graphs are NOT equal. It is enough to notice that since but . However, both of these graphs consist of three vertices with edges connecting every pair of vertices. We can draw them as follows:     A graph with three vertices arranged as a triangle, with edges along the border of the triangle. The vertices are labeled a, b, and c.     A graph with three vertices arranged as a triangle, with edges along the border of the triangle. The vertices are labeled u, v, and w.    Clearly we want to say these graphs are basically the same, so while they are not equal, they will be isomorphic . We can rename the vertices of one graph and get the second graph as the result.     graph isomorphic (intuitive definition)  Intuitively, graphs are isomorphic  isomorphic intuitive definition  if they are basically the same, or better yet, if they are the same except for the names of the vertices. To make the concept of renaming vertices precise, we give the following definitions:   isomorphism of graphs   isomorphic precise definition   graph isomorphic (precise definition)   Isomorphic Graphs  An isomorphism between two graphs and is a bijection between the vertices of the graphs such that is an edge in if and only if is an edge in .  Two graphs are isomorphic if there is an isomorphism between them. In this case we write .   An isomorphism is simply a function which renames the vertices. It must be a bijection so every vertex gets a new name. These newly named vertices must be connected by edges precisely when they were connected by edges with their old names.   graph equal vs isomorphic    Decide whether the graphs and are equal or isomorphic.   ,    ,     The graphs are NOT equal, since but . However, since both graphs contain the same number of vertices and same number of edges, they might be isomorphic (this is not enough in most cases, but it is a good start).  We can try to build an isomorphism. How about we say , , and . This is definitely a bijection, but to make sure that the function is an isomorphism, we must make sure it respects the edge relation . In , vertices and are connected by an edge. In , and are connected by an edge. So far, so good, but we must check the other three edges. The edge in corresponds to , but here we have a problem. There is no edge between and in . Thus is NOT an isomorphism.  Not all hope is lost, however. Just because is not an isomorphism does not mean that there is no isomorphism at all. We can try again. At this point it might be helpful to draw the graphs to see how they should match up.     The graph G1 with four vertices arranged in a diamond. The top vertex (a) is connected to the three other vertices (d on the left, b on the right, and c below). There is one additional edge between d and c.     The graph G2 with four vertices arranged in a diamond. The top vertex (a) is connected to the the vertices c below and b on the right. There is two additional edges between d (left) and c and between b and c .    Alternatively, notice that in , the vertex is adjacent to every other vertex. In , there is also a vertex with this property: . So build the bijection by defining to start with. Next, where should we send ? In , the vertex is only adjacent to vertex . There is exactly one vertex like this in , namely . So let . As for the last two, in this example, we have a free choice: let and (switching these would be fine as well).  We should check that this really is an isomorphism. It is definitely a bijection. We must make sure that the edges are respected. The four edges in are .  Under the proposed isomorphism these become  , which are precisely the edges in . Thus is an isomorphism, so      isomorphism class   graph isomorphism class  Sometimes we will talk about a graph with a special name (like or the Petersen graph ) or perhaps draw a graph without any labels. In this case we are really referring to all graphs isomorphic to any copy of that particular graph. A collection of isomorphic graphs is often called an isomorphism class . This is not unlike geometry, where we might have more than one copy of a particular triangle. There instead of isomorphic we say congruent .  There are other relationships between graphs that we care about, other than equality and being isomorphic. For example, compare the following pair of graphs:     A graph with six vertices arranged in a hexagon, with edges between every possible pair of vertices.     Four vertices arranged in a diamond, with edges between every possible pair of vertices.    These are definitely not isomorphic, but notice that the graph on the right looks like it might be part of the graph on the left, especially if we draw it like this:    A graph with six vertices arranged in a hexagon with edges between every pair of vertices. Six edges are drawn in bold, forming a slanted rectangle with an X through it.   We would like to say that the smaller graph is a subgraph of the larger.  We should give a careful definition of this. In fact, there are two reasonable notions for what a subgraph should mean.   Subgraphs  subgraph   graph subgraph   induced subgraph   We say that is a subgraph of , and write , provided and .  We say that is an induced subgraph of provided and every edge in whose vertices are still in is also an edge in .   Notice that every induced subgraph is also an ordinary subgraph, but not conversely. Think of a subgraph as the result of deleting some vertices and edges from the larger graph. For the subgraph to be an induced subgraph, we can still delete vertices, but now we only delete those edges that included the deleted vertices.    Consider the graphs:      The graph G1 consisting of six vertices arranged in a triangle. Starting with the bottom left vertex and traveling around the triangle clockwise, the vertices are labeled a, d, f, e, c, b. Edges connect vertices at the corners of the triangle to vertices along their edges of the triangle. These center vertices are also connected to each of the other center vertices.     The graph G2 of four vertices: a horizontal row of three, labeled a, b, c, and a vertex labeled d centered between and above a and b. Edges connect a, b, and d (forming a triangle) and a fourth edge connects b to c.     The graph G3 of five vertices. Vertices a, b, and c are aligned in a horizontal row. Vertices d and f form a line with a in a line that slants up and to the right. There are edges between a and d, between d and f, between d and b, and between b and c.     The graph G4 with five vertices: a, b, and c form a horizontal row, d and f line up with a in a line slanting up and the to the right. The vertices form a triangle, and edges are arranged to fill in the outside border of the triangle. Vertices d and b are also connected by and edge.    Here both and are subgraphs of . But only is an induced subgraph. Every edge in that connects vertices in is also an edge in . In , the edge is in but not , even though vertices and are in .  The graph is NOT a subgraph of , even though it looks like all we did is remove vertex . The reason is that in we have the edge but this is not an element of , so we don't have the required .     simple graph   graph simple  Back to some basic graph theory definitions. Notice that all the graphs we have drawn above have the property that no pair of vertices is connected more than once, and no vertex is connected to itself. Graphs like these are sometimes called simple , although we will just call them graphs . This is because our definition for a graph says that the edges form a set of 2-element subsets of the vertices. Remember that it doesn't make sense to say a set contains an element more than once. So no pair of vertices can be connected by an edge more than once. Also, since each edge must be a set containing two vertices, we cannot have a single vertex connected to itself by an edge.   multigraph   graph multigraph   multiset relation to multigraph  That said, there are times we want to consider double (or more) edges and single edge loops. For example, the graph we drew for the Bridges of Königsberg problem had double edges because there really are two bridges connecting a particular island to the near shore. We will call these objects multigraphs . This is a good name: a multiset is a set in which we are allowed to include a single element multiple times.   graph connected   connected graph  The graphs above are also connected : you can get from any vertex to any other vertex by following some path of edges. A graph that is not connected can be thought of as two separate graphs drawn close together. For example, the following graph is NOT connected because there is no path from to :    A graph consisting of eight vertices arranged in two overlapping diamonds, with edges forming the border of those diamonds. The vertex on the far left is labeled a and the vertex on the far right is labeled b.    complete graph   graph complete     Vertices in a graph do not always have edges between them. If we add all possible edges, then the resulting graph is called complete . That is, a graph is complete if every pair of vertices is connected by an edge. Since a graph is determined completely by which vertices are adjacent to which other vertices, there is only one complete graph with a given number of vertices. We give these a special name:     the complete graph on vertices  is the complete graph on vertices.   vertex degree   degree   graph degree  Each vertex in is adjacent to other vertices. We call the number of edges emanating from a given vertex the degree of that vertex. So every vertex in has degree . How many edges does have? One might think the answer should be , since we count edges times (once for each vertex). However, each edge is incident to 2 vertices, so we counted every edge exactly twice. Thus there are edges in . Alternatively, we can say there are edges, since to draw an edge we must choose 2 of the vertices.  In general, if we know the degrees of all the vertices in a graph, we can find the number of edges. The sum of the degrees of all vertices will always be twice the number of edges, since each edge adds to the degree of two vertices. Notice this means that the sum of the degrees of all vertices in any graph must be even!  This is our first example of a general result about all graphs. It seems innocent enough, but we will use it to prove all sorts of other statements. So let's give it a name and state it formally.   Handshake Lemma  handshake lemma   degree sum formula   counting edges in a graph    In any graph, the sum of the degrees of vertices in the graph is always twice the number of edges.    The handshake lemma A lemma is a mathematical statement that is primarily of importance in that it is used to establish other results. is sometimes called the degree sum formula , and can be written symbolically as . Here we are using the notation for the degree of the vertex .   degree degree sequence   graph degree sequence   vertex degree degree sequence  One use for the lemma is to actually find the number of edges in a graph. To do this, you must be given the degree sequence for the graph (or be able to find it from other information). This is a list of every degree of every vertex in the graph, generally written in non-increasing order.    How many vertices and edges must a graph have if its degree sequence is ?    The number of vertices is easy to find: it is the number of degrees in the sequence: 7. To find the number of edges, we compute the degree sum: , so the number of edges is half this: 10.    The handshake lemma also tells us what is not possible.    At a recent math seminar, 9 mathematicians greeted each other by shaking hands. Is it possible that each mathematician shook hands with exactly 7 people at the seminar?    It seems like this should be possible. Each mathematician chooses one person to not shake hands with. But this cannot happen. We are asking whether a graph with 9 vertices can have each vertex have degree 7. If such a graph existed, the sum of the degrees of the vertices would be . This would be twice the number of edges (handshakes) resulting in a graph with edges. That is impossible. Thus at least one (in fact an odd number) of the mathematicians must have shaken hands with an even number of people at the seminar.    We can generalize the previous example to get the following proposition. A proposition is a general statement in mathematics, similar to a theorem, although generally of lesser importance.     In any graph, the number of vertices with odd degree must be even.    Suppose there were a graph with an odd number of vertices with odd degree. Then the sum of the degrees in the graph would be odd, which is impossible, by the handshake lemma.    We will consider further applications of the handshake lemma in the exercises.   bipartite graph   graph bipartite   complete bipartite graph  One final definition: we say a graph is bipartite if the vertices can be divided into two sets, and , with no two vertices in adjacent and no two vertices in adjacent. The vertices in can be adjacent to some or all of the vertices in . If each vertex in is adjacent to all the vertices in , then the graph is a complete bipartite graph , and gets a special name: , where and . The graph in the houses and utilities puzzle is .    Named Graphs  complete graph   complete bipartite graph   cycle type of graph   path type of graph   graph complete   graph complete bipartite   graph path   graph cycle   Some graphs are used more than others, and get special names.

The cycle on vertices, just one big loop.    the cycle on vertices        The path on vertices (so edges), just one long path.    the path on vertices          The graph K5: five vertices arranged in a pentagon. Each vertex is connected to each other vertex by an edge.     The graph K2,3: a row of two vertices on top and three on bottom. Each vertex in the top row is connected to each vertex on the bottom row.     The graph C6: a cycle of six vertices connected by six edges arranged as a hexagon.     The graph P5: six vertices connected by five edges. The first and last vertex have one edge, each other vertex has two edges (connecting to the previous and next vertex on the path).      Graph Theory Definitions  There are a lot of definitions to keep track of in graph theory. Here is a glossary of the terms we have already used and will soon encounter.   graph   vertex   edge   Graph  A collection of vertices , some of which are connected by edges .

If a path starts and ends at the same vertex, it is called a cycle .    Planar  planar graph   graph planar   A graph which can be drawn (in the plane) without any edges crossing.    Subgraph  subgraph   induced subgraph   graph subgraph   graph induced subgraph   We say that is a subgraph of if every vertex and edge of is also a vertex or edge of . We say is an induced subgraph of if every vertex of is a vertex of and each pair of vertices in are adjacent in if and only if they are adjacent in .

Is there more than one graph with five vertices and six edges? Explain what this question even means and how you would answer it.     If a graph has 10 vertices, each with degree 4, how many edges does it have?  Number of edges:             What questions do you have after reading this section? Write at least one question about the content of this section that we could answer in class or online.     Practice Problems    Consider the graph :   Which of the graphs below is isomorphic to ?         A   B   C        Indicate the isomorphism by listing the vertices separated by commas in the order they correspond to A,B,C,D,E,F,G, respectively.    No correct answer specified         Which of the following graphs are isomophic?        A   B            C   D               The graph has 10 vertices, all of degree 3. How many edges does have?

Answer:                        I m thinking of a graph which has degree sequence \\((9,9,9,8,8,8,8,7,6,6)\\). How many edges must my graph have?        By the handshake lemma, the number of edges is twice the sum of the degrees of vertices in the graph.  The sum of the degrees is , so there are edges.         1. What is the largest such that is a subgraph of ?  2. What is the largest such that is a subgraph of ?  3. What is the largest such that is an induced subgraph of ?  4. What is the largest such that is an induced subgraph of ?   Remember that is the path that contains edges and vertices.                             handshakes connection to graphs   If 10 people each shake hands with each other, how many handshakes took place? What does this question have to do with graph theory?   This is asking for the number of edges in . Each vertex (person) has degree (shook hands with) 9 (people). So the sum of the degrees is . However, the degrees count each edge (handshake) twice, so there are 45 edges in the graph. That is how many handshakes took place.    Among a group of 5 people, is it possible for everyone to be friends with exactly 2 of the people in the group? What about 3 of the people in the group?   It is possible for everyone to be friends with exactly 2 people. You could arrange the 5 people in a circle and say that everyone is friends with the two people on either side of them (so you get the graph ). However, it is not possible for everyone to be friends with 3 people. That would lead to a graph with an odd number of odd degree vertices which is impossible since the sum of the degrees must be even.    Is it possible for two different (non-isomorphic) graphs to have the same number of vertices and the same number of edges? What if the degrees of the vertices in the two graphs are the same (so both graphs have vertices with degrees 1, 2, 2, 3, and 4, for example)? Draw two such graphs or explain why not.   Both situations are possible. Go find some examples.    Are the two graphs below equal? Are they isomorphic? If they are isomorphic, give the isomorphism. If not, explain.  Graph 1: , .   Graph 2:     A graph with five vertices arranged in a pentagon, labeled a through e, starting with the vertex at the top and proceeding counterclockwise. Edges between vertices a, c, and d make a triangle. Edges between b, c, d, and e form a quadralateral.     The graphs are not equal. For example, graph 1 has an edge but graph 2 does not have that edge. They are isomorphic. One possible isomorphism is defined by , , , , .    Consider the following two graphs:         ,   .       ,   ,         Let be a function that takes the vertices of Graph 1 to vertices of Graph 2. The function is given by the following table:                                          Does define an isomorphism between Graph 1 and Graph 2?    Define a new function (with ) that defines an isomorphism between Graph 1 and Graph 2.    Is the graph pictured below isomorphic to Graph 1 and Graph 2? Explain.     A graph with seven vertices. Six of the vertices are arranged in rectangle, three across and two down, with edges around the perimeter. The seventh vertex is in the center, with edges connecting it to the vertices directly above and below it, and to the two outside vertices in the bottom row.         What is the largest number of edges possible in a graph with 10 vertices? What is the largest number of edges possible in a bipartite graph with 10 vertices? What is the largest number of edges possible in a tree with 10 vertices?   The bipartite graph is a little tricky. You will definitely want a complete bipartite graph, but it could be or maybe , or     Which of the graphs below are bipartite? Justify your answers.     A graph with five vertices. Four vertices make up the corners of a diamond; the last vertex is in the center. Edges form the perimeter of the diamond and connect the center vertex to the two corners on the left and right.     A graph consisting of six vertices arranged in a hexagon. Edges connect each vertex to two others, but not in a cycle around the outside of the hexagon. However, following along the edges does visit every vertex.     A graph consisting of seven vertices arranged in a seven-sided polygon, with edges forming the perimeter of the polygon.     A graph consisting of a single vertex with eight edges connecting to eight vertices arranged in a circle around the central vertex.     The first graph is bipartite, which can be seen by labeling it as follows.     A graph with five vertices. Four vertices make up the corners of a diamond; the last vertex is in the center. Edges form the perimeter of the diamond and connect the center vertex to the two corners on the left and right. The vertices on left and right are labeled A, the three vertices in the center column are each labeled B.    Two of the remaining three are also bipartite.    For which is the graph bipartite?    is bipartite; is not. What about all the other values of ?    For each of the following, try to give two different unlabeled graphs with the given properties, or explain why doing so is impossible.   Two different trees with the same number of vertices and the same number of edges. A tree is a connected graph with no cycles.    Two different graphs with 8 vertices all of degree 2.    Two different graphs with 5 vertices all of degree 4.    Two different graphs with 5 vertices all of degree 3.         For example:     A graph consisting of a vertex with three edges connecting it to three vertices in a row above it.     A graph consisting of four vertices arranged in a V. The left point of the V connects to the bottom corner of the V. That vertex is connected to a vertex half way up the right side of the V, which is then connected to the vertex at the right point of the V.      This is not possible if we require the graphs to be connected. If not, we could take as one graph and two copies of as the other.    Not possible. If you have a graph with 5 vertices all of degree 4, then every vertex must be adjacent to every other vertex. This is the graph .    This is not possible. In fact, there is not even one graph with this property (such a graph would have edges).       Decide whether the statements below about subgraphs are true or false. For those that are true, briefly explain why (1 or 2 sentences). For any that are false, give a counterexample.   Any subgraph of a complete graph is also complete.    Any induced subgraph of a complete graph is also complete.    Any subgraph of a bipartite graph is bipartite.    Any subgraph of a tree is a tree.         False.    True.    True.    False.       Let be a list of positive integers that sum to (i.e., ). Use two graphs containing vertices to explain why .   How many edges does have? One of the two graphs will not be connected (unless ).   graph neighbors  neighbors of vertices   We often define graph theory concepts using set theory. For example, given a graph and a vertex , we define . We define . The goal of this problem is to figure out what all this means.   Let be the graph with and . Find , , , and .

A graph is a way of representing the relationships between elements in a set: an edge between the vertices and tells us that is related to (which we can write as ). Not all sorts of relationships can be represented by a graph though. For each relationship described below, either draw the graph or explain why the relationship cannot be represented by a graph.   The set and the relationship when is a non-zero multiple of 3.    The set and the relationship when is a multiple of .    The set and the relationship when .

  "body": " Trees    Consider the graph drawn below.     A graph with seven vertices arranged in three rows: two on top, three in the middle, and two on bottom. The four vertices on top and bottom have edges forming a square. The vertex in the middle of the middle row is adjacent to the four vertices on top and bottom. The vertices on the left and right of the middle row are adjacent to the top and bottom vertices closest to them.       Find a subgraph with the smallest number of edges that is still connected and contains all the vertices.    Find a subgraph with the largest number of edges that doesn't contain any cycles.    What do you notice about the number of edges in your examples above? Is this a coincidence?      One very useful and common approach to studying graph theory is to restrict your focus to graphs of a particular kind. For example, you could try to really understand just complete graphs or just bipartite graphs, instead of trying to understand all graphs in general. That is what we are going to do now, looking at trees . Hopefully by the end of this section we will have a better understanding of this class of graph, and also understand why it is important enough to warrant its own section.   Definition of a Tree  tree  forest  A tree is a connected graph containing no cycles. Sometimes this is stated as a tree is an acyclic connected graph;  acyclic is just a fancy word for containing no cycles.    A forest is a graph containing no cycles. Note that this means that a connected forest is a tree.   Does the definition above agree with your intuition for what graphs we should call trees? Try thinking of examples of trees and make sure they satisfy the definition. One thing to keep in mind is that while the trees we study in graph theory are related to trees you might see in other subjects, the correspondence is not exact. For instance, in anthropology, you might study family trees, like the one below,     A family tree with \"Me\" at the top, branching down to the left to \"Mom\" and to the right to \"Dad\". \"Mom\" has branches leading down to \"Maternal Grandma\" and \"Maternal Grandpa\". \"Dad\" has branches down to \"Paternal Grandma\" and \"Paternal Grandpa\".    So far so good, but while your grandparents are (probably) not blood-relatives, if we go back far enough, it is likely that they did have some common ancestor. If you trace the tree back from you to that common ancestor, then down through your other grandparent, you would have a cycle, and thus the graph would not be a tree.  You might also have seen something called a decision tree (such as the algorithm for deciding whether a series converges or diverges). Sometimes these too contain cycles, as the decision for one node might lead you back to a previous step.   tree rooted  rooted tree Both the examples of trees above also have another feature worth mentioning: there is a clear order to the vertices in the tree. In general, there is no reason for a tree to have this added structure, although we can impose such a structure by considering rooted trees , where we simply designate one vertex as the root . We will consider such trees in more detail later in this section.    Properties of Trees  We wish to really understand trees. This means we should discover properties of trees; what makes them special and what is special about them.  A tree is a connected graph with no cycles. Is there anything else we can say? It would be nice to have other equivalent conditions for a graph to be a tree. That is, we would like to know whether there are any graph theoretic properties that all trees have, and perhaps even that only trees have.  To get a feel for the sorts of things we can say, we will consider three propositions about trees. These will also illustrate important proof techniques that apply to graphs in general, and happen to be a little easier for trees.  Our first proposition gives an alternate definition for a tree. That is, it gives necessary and sufficient conditions for a graph to be a tree.    A graph is a tree if and only if between every pair of distinct vertices of there is a unique path.    This is an if and only if statement, so we must prove two implications. We start by proving that if is a tree, then between every pair of distinct vertices there is a unique path.  Assume is a tree, and let and be distinct vertices (if only has one vertex, then the conclusion is satisfied automatically). We must show two things to show that there is a unique path between and : that there is a path, and that there is not more than one path. The first of these is automatic, since is a tree, it is connected, so there is a path between any pair of vertices.  To show the path is unique, we suppose there are two paths between and , and get a contradiction. The two paths might start out the same, but since they are different, there is some first vertex after which the two paths diverge. However, since the two paths both end at , there is some first vertex after that they have in common, call it . Now consider the two paths from to . Taken together, these form a cycle, which contradicts our assumption that is a tree.  Now we consider the converse: if between every pair of distinct vertices of there is a unique path, then is a tree. So assume the hypothesis: between every pair of distinct vertices of there is a unique path. To prove that is a tree, we must show it is connected and contains no cycles.  The first half of this is easy: is connected, because there is a path between every pair of vertices. To show that has no cycles, we assume it does, for the sake of contradiction. Let and be two distinct vertices in a cycle of . Since we can get from to by going clockwise or counterclockwise around the cycle, there are two paths from and , contradicting our assumption.  We have established both directions so we have completed the proof.    Read the proof above very carefully. Notice that both directions had two parts: the existence of paths, and the uniqueness of paths (which related to the fact that there were no cycles). In this case, these two parts were really separate. In fact, if we just considered graphs with no cycles (a forest), then we could still do the parts of the proof that explore the uniqueness of paths between vertices, even if there might not exist paths between vertices.  This observation allows us to state the following corollary : A corollary is another sort of provable statement, like a proposition or theorem, but one that follows direction from another already established statement, or its proof.     A graph is a forest if and only if between any pair of vertices in there is at most one path.    We do not give a proof of the corollary (it is, after all, supposed to follow directly from the proposition) but for practice, you are asked to give a careful proof in the exercises. When you do so, try to use proof by contrapositive instead of proof by contradiction.   leaf Our second proposition tells us that all trees have leaves : vertices of degree one.    Any tree with at least two vertices has at least two vertices of degree one.    We give a proof by contradiction. Let be a tree with at least two vertices, and suppose, contrary to stipulation, that there are not two vertices of degree one.  Let be a path in of longest possible length. Let and be the endpoints of the path. Since does not have two vertices of degree one, at least one of these must have degree two or higher. Say that it is . We know that is adjacent to a vertex in the path , but now it must also be adjacent to another vertex, call it .  Where is ? It cannot be a vertex of , because if it was, there would be two distinct paths from to : the edge between them, and the first part of (up to ). But also cannot be outside of , for if it was, there would be a path from to that was longer than , which has longest possible length.  This contradiction proves that there must be at least two vertices of degree one. In fact, we can say a little more: and must both have degree one.    The proposition is quite useful when proving statements about trees. because we often prove statements about trees by induction . This is a proof technique that we investigate fully in , but for now, all we need to understand is that it is useful to compare a given tree to smaller trees. To show something is true of a tree with vertices, we will assume the thing is true of all trees with vertices. By removing a vertex of degree 1, we get this smaller tree, and then we just need to show that putting the vertex back doesn't mess us up.   Is there a tree with exactly 7 vertices and 7 edges? Try to draw one. Could a tree with 7 vertices have only 5 edges? There is a good reason that these seem impossible to draw.   tree number of edges and vertices   Let be a tree with vertices and edges. Then .    We will prove that this proposition is true for all possible values of . Note that if , then the tree must have edges, so yes, . We could then look at trees with vertices (there is only one, and it has edges) and then all trees with vertices, and then , and so on, but that would take forever. Literally!   minimal criminal Instead, we will do a version of proof by contradiction called the minimal criminal . We will assume the proposition is not true (just like we would start any proof by contradiction). This means that there is some smallest tree for which it isn't true. If this smallest counterexample (i.e., minimal criminal) has vertices, then we are guaranteed that all trees with vertices are not counterexamples. Let's see how this works out.   Suppose, for the sake of contradiction, that the proposition is not true for all trees. Let be a tree for which the proposition is not true with smallest number of vertices among all the counterexamples. Let be the number of vertices of .  Since the only tree with one vertex has zero edges, that cannot be our tree , so we can assume . In particular, we know by that must contain at least one vertex of degree 1, call it .  Let be the tree resulting from removing from (together with its incident edge). Since we removed a leaf, is still a tree (the unique paths between pairs of vertices in are the same as the unique paths between them in ).  Now has vertices. Since was the smallest tree for which the proposition isn't true, we know that the proposition is true for : must have one fewer edges than vertices. That is has edges. But has one more edge than , so it has edges. This contradicts our assumption that does not satisfy the proposition, which completes our proof.      Rooted Trees  rooted tree  tree rooted  So far, we have thought of trees only as a particular kind of graph. However, it is often useful to add additional structure to trees to help solve problems. Data is often structured like a tree. This book, for example, has a tree structure: draw a vertex for the book itself. Then draw vertices for each chapter, connected to the book vertex. Under each chapter, draw a vertex for each section, connecting it to the chapter it belongs to. The graph will not have any cycles; it will be a tree. But a tree with clear hierarchy which is not present if we don't identify the book vertex as the top .   root (in a tree) As soon as one vertex of a tree is designated as the root , then every other vertex on the tree can be characterized by its position relative to the root. This works because there is a unique path between any two vertices in a tree. So from any vertex, we can travel back to the root in exactly one way. This also allows us to describe how distinct vertices in a rooted tree are related.   parent (in a rooted tree)  child (in a rooted tree) If two vertices are adjacent, then we say one of them is the parent of the other, which is called the child of the parent. Of the two, the parent is the vertex that is closer to the root. Thus the root of a tree is a parent, but is not the child of any vertex (and is unique in this respect: all non-root vertices have exactly one parent).   descendant (in a rooted tree)  ancestor (in a rooted tree) Not surprisingly, the child of a child of a vertex is called the grandchild of the vertex (and it is the grandparent ). More in general, we say that a vertex is a descendent of a vertex provided is a vertex on the path from to the root. Then we would call an ancestor of .   sibling (in a rooted tree) For most trees (in fact, all except paths with one end the root), there will be pairs of vertices neither of which is a descendant of the other. We might call these cousins or siblings. In fact, vertices and are called siblings provided they have the same parent. Note that siblings are never adjacent (do you see why?).    Consider the tree below.     A labeled tree. At the center of the drawing is the vertex e, adjacent to f (top right), g (bottom right), d (bottom left), c (middle left) and b (top left). Vertex c is also adjacent to vertex a to its left. Vertex f is adjacent to h (to its right) and i (to its down-right).    If we designate vertex as the root, then , , and are the children of , and are siblings of each other. Among the other things we cay say are that is a child of , and a descendant of . The vertex is a descendant of , in fact, is a grandchild of . Vertices and are siblings, since they have the common parent .  Notice how this changes if we pick a different vertex for the root. If is the root, then its lone child is , which also has only one child, namely . We would then have the child of (instead of the other way around), and is the descendant of , instead of the ancestor. and are now siblings.    All of this flowery language helps us describe how to navigate through a tree. Traversing a tree, visiting each vertex in some order, is a key step in many algorithms. Even if the tree is not rooted, we can always form a rooted tree by picking any vertex as the root. Here is an example of why doing so can be helpful.    Explain why every tree is a bipartite graph.    To show that a graph is bipartite, we must divide the vertices into two sets and so that no two vertices in the same set are adjacent. Here is an algorithm that does just this.  Designate any vertex as the root. Put this vertex in set . Now put all of the children of the root in set . None of these children are adjacent (they are siblings), so we are good so far. Now put into every child of every vertex in (i.e., every grandchild of the root). Keep going until all vertices have been assigned one of the sets, alternating between and every generation. That is, a vertex is in set if and only if it is the child of a vertex in set .     breadth first search  search breadth first The key to how we partitioned the tree in the example was to know which vertex to assign to a set next. We chose to visit all vertices in the same generation before any vertices of the next generation. This is usually called a breadth first search (we say search because you often traverse a tree looking for vertices with certain properties).   depth first search  search depth first In contrast, we could also have partitioned the tree in a different order. Start with the root, put it in . Then look for one child of the root to put in . Then find a child of that vertex, into , and then find its child, into , and so on. When you get to a vertex with no children, retreat to its parent and see if the parent has any other children. So we travel as far from the root as fast as possible, then backtrack until we can move forward again. This is called depth first search .  These algorithmic explanations can serve as a proof that every tree is bipartite, although care needs to be spent to prove that the algorithms are correct . Another approach to prove that all trees are bipartite, using induction, is requested in the exercises.    Spanning Trees  spanning tree  tree spanning  One of the advantages of trees is that they give us a few simple ways to travel through the vertices. If a connected graph is not a tree, then we can still use these traversal algorithms if we identify a subgraph that is a tree.  First we should consider if this even makes sense. Given any connected graph , will there always be a subgraph that is a tree? Well, that is actually too easy: you could just take a single vertex of . If we want to use this subgraph to tell us how to visit all vertices, then we want our subgraph to include all of the vertices. We call such a tree a spanning tree . It turns out that every connected graph has one (and usually many).    spanning tree    tree  spanning   Spanning tree  Given a connected graph , a spanning tree of is a subgraph of which is a tree and includes all the vertices of .  Every connected graph has a spanning tree.   How do we know? We can give an algorithm for finding a spanning tree! Start with a connected graph . If there is no cycle, then is already a tree and we are done. If there is a cycle, let be any edge in that cycle and consider the new graph (i.e., the graph you get by deleting ). This tree is still connected since belonged to a cycle, there were at least two paths between its incident vertices. Now repeat: if has no cycles, we are done, otherwise define to be , where is an edge in a cycle in . Keep going. This process must eventually stop, since there are only a finite number of edges to remove. The result will be a tree, and since we never removed any vertex, a spanning tree.  This is by no means the only algorithm for finding a spanning tree. You could have started with the empty graph and added edges that belong to as long as adding them would not create a cycle. You have some choices as to which edges you add first: you could always add an edge adjacent to edges you have already added (after the first one, of course), or add them using some other order. Which spanning tree you end up with depends on these choices.    Find two different spanning trees of the graph,     A graph with seven vertices arranged in three rows: two on top, three in the middle, and two on bottom. The four vertices on top and bottom have edges forming a square. The vertex in the middle of the middle row is adjacent to the four vertices on top and bottom. The vertices on the left and right of the middle row are adjacent to the top and bottom vertices closest to them.      Here are two spanning trees.     A graph with seven vertices arranged in three rows: two on top, three in the middle, and two on bottom. The vertex on the middle left is adjacent to the vertex on the top left. This is adjacent to the vertex in the middle of the middle row, and the vertex on the top right. The top right vertex is adjacent to the middle right, which is adjacent to the vertex on the bottom right, which is adjacent to the vertex on the bottom left. Thus there are a total of 6 edges.     A graph with seven vertices arranged in three rows: two on top, three in the middle, and two on bottom. The vertex in the middle of the middle row is adjacent to the four vertices on the top and bottom rows. The vertices on the top row are each adjacent to the vertices in the middle row on their side. Thus there are a total of 6 edges.        spanning tree minimum    minimum spanning tree  Although we will not consider this in detail, these algorithms are usually applied to weighted graphs. Here every edge has some weight or cost assigned to it. The goal is to find a spanning tree that has the smallest possible combined weight. Such a tree is called a minimum spanning tree . Finding the minimum spanning tree uses basically the same algorithms as we described above, but when picking an edge to add, you always pick the smallest (or when removing an edge, you always remove the largest).   Prim's algorithm    Kruskal's algorithm  If you add the smallest edge adjacent to edges you have already added, you are doing Prim's algorithm . If you add the smallest edge in the entire graph, you are following Kruskal's algorithm .      Suppose is a tree with 10 vertices. Which of the following statements must be true about ? Select all that apply.      has a unique path between every pair of vertices.      If you removed any edge from , the resulting graph would be disconnected.      If you added any edge between two vertices in (that were not already adjacent), the resulting graph would have a cycle.       has exactly two vertices of degree one.       If a tree has 20 vertices, how many edges does it have?  Number of edges:             What questions do you have after reading this section? Write at least one question about the content of this section that you are curious about.     Practice Problems    Are the following statements true or false?    Every connected forest is a tree.    If a connected graph with 18 vertices has 18 edges, then the graph contains a cycle.    Every forest is a tree.    Every tree with 15 vertices has the same number of edges.    There is a tree with 9 vertices and 9 edges.           A forest contains 33 vertices and 29 edges. How many connected components does the graph have?              A connected graph with 21 vertices contains 32 edges. Without knowing which particular graph this is, what is the smallest and largest possible number of edges you can remove to get a spanning tree?  Smallest number of edges to remove:  Largest number of edges to remove:             Every spanning tree must still contain 21 vertices. Since it is a tree, it will have edges.  Thus we must remove 12 edges to get a spanning tree.         The average degree of a tree is 1.996 (that is, if you sum the degrees of vertices and divide by the number of vertices, you get 1.996).  How many vertices does the tree have?              A tree contains some number of leaves (degree 1 vertices) and four non-leaf vertices. The degrees of the non-leaf vertices are 7, 6, 3, and 2. How many leaves does the tree have?  Smallest number of leaves possible:  Largest number of leaves possible:             Let be the number of leaves. Then the sum of degrees will be . This is twice the number of edges. Since the number of edges is one less than the number of vertices, which is , we also know that the number of edges is .  Thus we have . Solving for gives .         Additional Exercises   Which of the following graphs are trees?    with and      with and      with and      with and          This is not a tree since it contains a cycle. Note also that there are too many edges to be a tree, since we know that all trees with vertices have edges.    This is a tree since it is connected and contains no cycles (which you can see by drawing the graph). All paths are trees.    This is a tree since it is connected and contains no cycles (draw the graph). All stars are trees.    This is a not a tree since it is not connected. Note that there are not enough edges to be a tree.       For each degree sequence below, decide whether it must always, must never, or could possibly be a degree sequence for a tree. Remember, a degree sequence lists out the degrees (number of edges incident to the vertex) of all the vertices in a graph in non-increasing order.                            This must be the degree sequence for a tree. This is because the vertex of degree 4 must be adjacent to the four vertices of degree 1 (there are no other vertices for it to be adjacent to), and thus we get a star.    This cannot be a tree. Each degree 3 vertex is adjacent to all but one of the vertices in the graph. Thus each must be adjacent to one of the degree 1 vertices (and not the other). That means both degree 3 vertices are adjacent to the degree 2 vertex, and to each other, so that means there is a cycle.  Alternatively, count how many edges there are!    This might or might not be a tree. The length 4 path has this degree sequence (this is a tree), but so does the union of a 3-cycle and a length 1 path (which is not connected, so not a tree).    This cannot be a tree. The sum of the degrees is 28, so there are 14 edges. But there are 14 vertices as well, so we don't have , meaning this cannot be a tree.       For each degree sequence below, decide whether it must always, must never, or could possibly be a degree sequence for a tree. Justify your answers.

Then is a tree, so would have , contrary to stipulation.    We define a forest to be a graph with no cycles.   Explain why this is a good name. That is, explain why a forest is a union of trees.    Suppose is a forest consisting of trees and vertices. How many edges does have? Explain.    Prove that any graph with vertices and edges that satisfies must contain a cycle (i.e., not be a forest).      For part (b), trying some simple examples should give you the formula. Then you just need to prove it is correct.    Give a careful proof of : A graph is a forest if and only if there is at most one path between any pair of vertices. Use proof by contrapositive (and not a proof by contradiction) for both directions.   Examining the proof of gives you most of what you need, but make sure to just give the relevant parts, and take care to not use proof by contradiction.    Give a careful proof by induction on the number of vertices, that every tree is bipartite.   You will need to remove a vertex of degree one, apply the inductive hypothesis to the result, and then say which set the degree one vertex to.    Consider the tree drawn below.     A labeled tree with nine vertices labeled a through h. Vertices a, b, e, f, and i are on a single row, adjacent on a path in that order from left to right. Vertex b is adjacent to c and d above it. Vertex f is adjacent to g and h about it.       Suppose we designate vertex as the root. List the children, parents and siblings of each vertex. Does any vertex other than have grandchildren?    Suppose is not chosen as the root. Does our choice of root vertex change the number of children has? The number of grandchildren? How many are there of each?    In fact, pick any vertex in the tree and suppose it is not the root. Explain why the number of children of that vertex does not depend on which other vertex is the root.    Does the previous part work for other trees? Give an example of a different tree for which it holds. Then either prove that it always holds or give an example of a tree for which it doesn't.      If is the root, then will have three children ( , , and ), all of which will be siblings, and have as their parent. will not have any children.  In general, how can you determine the number of children a vertex will have, if it is not a root?    Let be a rooted tree that contains vertices , , and (among possibly others). Prove that if is a descendant of both and , then is a descendant of or is a descendant of .    Unless it is already a tree, a given graph will have multiple spanning trees. How similar or different must these be?   Must all spanning trees of a given graph be isomorphic to each other? Explain why or give a counterexample.    Must all spanning trees of a given graph have the same number of edges? Explain why or give a counterexample.    Must all spanning trees of a graph have the same number of leaves (vertices of degree 1)? Explain why or give a counterexample.         No, although there are graphs for which this is true. For example, has a spanning tree that is a path (of three edges) and also a spanning tree that is a star (with center vertex of degree 3).    Yes. For a fixed graph, we have a fixed number of vertices. Any spanning tree of the graph will also have vertices, and since it is a tree, must have edges.    No, although there are graph for which this is true (note that if all spanning trees are isomorphic, then all spanning trees will have the same number of leaves). Again, is a counterexample. One spanning tree is a path, with only two leaves, another spanning tree is a star with 3 leaves.       Find all spanning trees of the graph below. How many different spanning trees are there? How many different spanning trees are there up to isomorphism (that is, if you grouped all the spanning trees by which are isomorphic, how many groups would you have)?     A graph with six vertices labeled a through f. Vertices a, b, and c form a triangle (with their edges), with a directly above b and c to the right of both. Vertex c is then adjacent to vertices d, f, and e, with d directly above f and e farther to the right. Vertices d and f are also adjacent to e.      Give an example of a graph that has exactly 7 different spanning trees. Note, it is acceptable for some or all of these spanning trees to be isomorphic.   There is an example with 7 edges.    Prove that every connected graph which is not itself a tree must have at last three different (although possibly isomorphic) spanning trees.   The previous exercise will be helpful.    Consider edges that must be in every spanning tree of a graph. Must every graph have such an edge? Give an example of a graph that has exactly one such edge.   Note that such an edge, if removed, would disconnect the graph. We call graphs that have an edge like this 1-connected .    "

We start by proving that if is a tree, then between every pair of distinct vertices there is a unique path.  Assume is a tree, and let and be distinct vertices (if only has one vertex, then the conclusion is satisfied automatically). We must show two things to show that there is a unique path between and : that there is a path, and that there is not more than one path. The first of these is automatic, since is a tree, it is connected, so there is a path between any pair of vertices.  To show the path is unique, we suppose there are two paths between and , and get a contradiction. The two paths might start out the same, but since they are different, there is some first vertex after which the two paths diverge. However, since the two paths both end at , there is some first vertex after that they have in common, call it . Now consider the two paths from to . Taken together, these form a cycle, which contradicts our assumption that is a tree.  Now we consider the converse: if between every pair of distinct vertices of there is a unique path, then is a tree. So assume the hypothesis: between every pair of distinct vertices of there is a unique path. To prove that is a tree, we must show it is connected and contains no cycles.  The first half of this is easy: is connected, because there is a path between every pair of vertices. To show that has no cycles, we assume it does, for the sake of contradiction. Let and be two distinct vertices in a cycle of . Since we can get from to by going clockwise or counterclockwise around the cycle, there are two paths from and , contradicting our assumption.  We have established both directions so we have completed the proof.   "

When a planar graph is drawn in this way, it divides the plane into regions called faces .   Draw, if possible, two different planar graphs with the same number of vertices, edges, and faces.    Draw, if possible, two different planar graphs with the same number of vertices and edges, but a different number of faces.       planar graph When is it possible to draw a graph so that none of the edges cross? If this is possible, we say the graph is planar (since you can draw it on the plane ).  Notice that the definition of planar includes the phrase it is possible to. This means that even if a graph does not look like it is planar, it still might be. Perhaps you can redraw it in a way in which no edges cross. For example, this is a planar graph:     A drawing of K2,3 with two vertices in a top row, each adjacent to each of the three vertices on the bottom row.   That is because we can redraw it like this:    Another drawing of K2,3. A single vertex on a top row is adjacent to three vertices in a row below it. Each of these vertices are adjacent to a single vertex below (and to the right of) them.    planar representation The graphs are the same, so if one is planar, the other must be too. However, the original drawing of the graph was not a planar representation of the graph.   face (planar graph)  planar region face (planar graph)  region (graph) face (planar graph) When a planar graph is drawn without edges crossing, the edges and vertices of the graph divide the plane into regions. We will call each region a face . The graph above has 3 faces (yes, we do include the outside region as a face). The number of faces does not change no matter how you draw the graph (as long as you do so without the edges crossing), so it makes sense to ascribe the number of faces as a property of the planar graph.  WARNING: you can only count faces when the graph is drawn in a planar way. For example, consider these two representations of the same graph:     A drawing of K4 with four vertices in a square and edges forming the sides of the square plus two more crossing through the center.     A drawing of K4 with four vertices arranged in a square and edges forming the sides of the square. Another edge crosses from the bottom left to the top right corners. A curved edge loops outside of the square from the top left to bottom right vertices. No edges intersect.    If you try to count faces using the graph on the left, you might say there are 5 faces (including the outside). But drawing the graph with a planar representation shows that in fact there are only 4 faces.  There is a connection between the number of vertices ( ), the number of edges ( ) and the number of faces ( ) in any connected planar graph. This relationship is called Euler's formula.   Euler's Formula for Planar Graphs  Euler's formula for planar graphs  For any connected planar graph with vertices, edges and faces, we have .   Why is Euler's formula true? One way to convince yourself of its validity is to draw a planar graph step by step. Start with the graph :    Two vertices connected by an edge.   Any connected graph (besides just a single isolated vertex) must contain this subgraph. Now build up to your graph by adding edges and vertices. Each step will consist of either adding a new vertex connected by a new edge to part of your graph (so creating a new spike ) or by connecting two vertices already in the graph with a new edge (completing a circuit).     A graph with four vertices arranged in a square. The top left vertex is adjacent to the other three vertices, and the top right and bottom right vertices are also adjacent. A dashed edge leads from the top right vertex of the square to a fifth vertex below and to its right.     A graph with four vertices arranged in a square. The top left vertex is adjacent to the other three vertices, and the top right and bottom right vertices are also adjacent. A dashed edge connects the bottom two vertices.    What do these moves do? When adding the spike, the number of edges increases by 1, the number of vertices increases by one, and the number of faces remains the same. But this means that does not change. Completing a circuit adds one edge, adds one face, and keeps the number of vertices the same. So again, does not change.  Since we can build any graph using a combination of these two moves, and doing so never changes the quantity , that quantity will be the same for all graphs. But notice that our starting graph has , and , so . This argument is essentially a proof by induction. A good exercise would be to rewrite it as a formal induction proof.    Non-planar Graphs  non-planar graph  planar graph non-planar graph   For the complete graphs , we would like to be able to say something about the number of vertices, edges, and (if the graph is planar) faces. Let's first consider :   How many vertices does have? How many edges?    If is planar, how many faces should it have?     Repeat parts (1) and (2) for , , and .  What about complete bipartite graphs? How many vertices, edges, and faces (if it were planar) does have? For which values of and are and planar?   Not all graphs are planar. If there are too many edges and too few vertices, then some of the edges will need to intersect. The smallest graph where this happens is .    A copy of K5: five vertices arranged in a pentagon with edges connecting every vertex to every other vertex.   If you try to redraw this without edges crossing, you quickly get into trouble. There seems to be one edge too many. In fact, we can prove that no matter how you draw it, will always have edges crossing.    non-planar graph  planar graph non-planar graph   is not planar.     The proof is by contradiction. So assume that is planar. Then the graph must satisfy Euler's formula for planar graphs. has 5 vertices and 10 edges, so we get , which says that if the graph is drawn without any edges crossing, there would be faces.  Now consider how many edges surround each face. Each face must be surrounded by at least 3 edges. Let be the total number of boundaries around all the faces in the graph. Thus we have that . But also , since each edge is used as a boundary exactly twice. Putting this together we get .  But this is impossible, since we have already determined that and , and . This is a contradiction so in fact is not planar.   The other simplest graph which is not planar is     A drawing of K3,3 with a row of three vertices on top, each adjacent to the three vertices in a row directly below.   Proving that is not planar answers the houses and utilities puzzle: it is not possible to connect each of three houses to each of three utilities without the lines crossing.    non-planar graph       planar graph  non-planar graph        is not planar.     Again, we proceed by contradiction. Suppose were planar. Then by Euler's formula there will be 5 faces, since , , and .  How many boundaries surround these 5 faces? Let be this number. Since each edge is used as a boundary twice, we have . Also, since each face is surrounded by 4 or more boundaries. We know this is true because is bipartite, so does not contain any 3-edge cycles. Thus .  But this would say that , which is clearly false. Thus is not planar.   Note the similarities and differences in these proofs. Both are proofs by contradiction, and both start with using Euler's formula to derive the (supposed) number of faces in the graph. Then we find a relationship between the number of faces and the number of edges based on how many edges surround each face. This is the only difference. In the proof for , we got and for we go . The coefficient of is the key. It is the smallest number of edges which could surround any face. If some number of edges surround a face, then these edges form a cycle. So that number is the size of the smallest cycle in the graph.   girth  graph girth In general, if we let be the size of the smallest cycle in a graph ( stands for girth , which is the technical term for this) then for any planar graph we have . When this disagrees with Euler's formula, we know for sure that the graph cannot be planar.    Polyhedra    regular polyhedron  polyhedron regular  Platonic solid regular polyhedron A cube cube is an example of a convex polyhedron. It contains 6 identical squares for its faces, 8 vertices, and 12 edges. The cube is a regular polyhedron (also known as a Platonic solid ) because each face is an identical regular polygon and each vertex joins an equal number of faces.  There are exactly four other regular polyhedra: the tetrahedron, octahedron, dodecahedron, and icosahedron with 4, 8, 12 and 20 faces respectively. How many vertices and edges do each of these have?    polyhedron  polyhedron  convex polyhedron Another area of mathematics where you might have heard the terms vertex,  edge, and face is geometry. A polyhedron is a geometric solid made up of flat polygonal faces joined at edges and vertices. We are especially interested in convex polyhedra, which means that any line segment connecting two points on the interior of the polyhedron must be entirely contained inside the polyhedron. An alternative definition for convex is that the internal angle formed by any two faces must be less than .  Notice that since , the vertices, edges and faces of a cube satisfy Euler's formula for planar graphs. This is not a coincidence. We can represent a cube as a planar graph by projecting the vertices and edges onto the plane. One such projection looks like this:    Eight vertices arranged as a smaller square inside a larger square. Edges from the perimeters of both squares, and edges connect each vertex of the small square to its closest vertex of the larger square.   In fact, every convex polyhedron can be projected onto the plane without edges crossing. Think of placing the polyhedron inside a sphere, with a light at the center of the sphere. The edges and vertices of the polyhedron cast a shadow onto the interior of the sphere. You can then cut a hole in the sphere in the middle of one of the projected faces and stretch the sphere to lie down flat on the plane. The face that was punctured becomes the outside face of the planar graph.  The point is, we can apply what we know about graphs (in particular planar graphs) to convex polyhedra. Since every convex polyhedron can be represented as a planar graph, we see that Euler's formula for planar graphs holds for all convex polyhedra as well. We also can apply the same sort of reasoning we use for graphs in other contexts to convex polyhedra. For example, we know that there is no convex polyhedron with 11 vertices all of degree 3, as this would make 33\/2 edges.    Is there a convex polyhedron consisting of three triangles and six pentagons? What about three triangles, six pentagons and five heptagons (7-sided polygons)?    How many edges would such polyhedra have? For the first proposed polyhedron, the triangles would contribute a total of 9 edges, and the pentagons would contribute 30. However, this counts each edge twice (as each edge borders exactly two faces), giving 39\/2 edges, an impossibility. There is no such polyhedron.  The second polyhedron does not have this obstacle. The extra 35 edges contributed by the heptagons give a total of 74\/2 = 37 edges. So far so good. Now how many vertices does this supposed polyhedron have? We can use Euler's formula. There are 14 faces, so we have or equivalently . But now use the vertices to count the edges again. Each vertex must have degree at least three (that is, each vertex joins at least three faces since the interior angle of all the polygons must be less that ), so the sum of the degrees of vertices is at least 75. Since the sum of the degrees must be exactly twice the number of edges, this says that there are strictly more than 37 edges. Again, there is no such polyhedron.    To conclude this application of planar graphs, consider the regular polyhedra. We claimed there are only five. How do we know this is true? We can prove it using graph theory.    There are exactly five regular polyhedra.     Recall that all the faces of a regular polyhedron are identical regular polygons, and that each vertex has the same degree. Consider four cases, depending on the type of regular polygon.   Case 1 : Each face is a triangle. Let be the number of faces. There are then edges. Using Euler's formula we have so . Now each vertex has the same degree, say . So the number of edges is also . Putting this together gives , which says .  Both and must be positive integers. Note that is an increasing function for positive , bounded above by a horizontal asymptote at . Thus the only possible values for are 3, 4, and 5. Each of these are possible. To get , we need (this is the tetrahedron). tetrahedron For we take (the octahedron). octahedron For take (the icosahedron). icosahedron Thus there are exactly three regular polyhedra with triangles for faces.   Case 2 : Each face is a square. Now we have . Using Euler's formula we get , and counting edges using the degree of each vertex gives us .  Solving for gives .  This is again an increasing function, but this time the horizontal asymptote is at , so the only possible value that could take is 3. This produces 6 faces, and we have a cube. There is only one regular polyhedron with square faces.   Case 3 : Each face is a pentagon. We perform the same calculation as above, this time getting so . Then , so .  Now the horizontal asymptote is at . This is less than 4, so we can only hope of making . We can do so by using 12 pentagons, getting the dodecahedron. dodecahedron This is the only regular polyhedron with pentagons as faces.   Case 4 : Each face is an -gon with . Following the same procedure as above, we deduce that , which will be increasing to a horizontal asymptote of . When , this asymptote is at . Any larger value of will give an even smaller asymptote. Therefore no regular polyhedra exist with faces larger than pentagons. Notice that you can tile the plane with hexagons. This is an infinite planar graph; each vertex has degree 3. These infinitely many hexagons correspond to the limit as to make .      Is the graph shown below planar? Explain your answer.

If we assume that were planar, then how many faces would it have?   .  However, since every face is bounded by at least edges, and every edge borders exactly faces, we can get a bound on the number of faces. What is the largest number of faces possible based on this line of reasoning?   .  This is a contradiction, so is not planar. QED.

It could be planar, and then it would have 6 faces, using Euler's formula: means . To make sure that it is actually planar though, we would need to draw a graph with those vertex degrees without edges crossing. This can be done by trial and error (and is possible).

Is it possible for a graph with 10 vertices and edges to be a connected planar graph? Explain.    Is there a connected planar graph with an odd number of faces where every vertex has degree 6? Prove your answer.   You can use the handshake lemma to find the number of edges, in terms of , the number of vertices.    I'm thinking of a polyhedron containing 12 faces. Seven are triangles and four are quadralaterals. The polyhedron has 11 vertices including those around the mystery face. How many sides does the last face have?   Say the last polyhedron has edges, and also vertices. The total number of edges the polyhedron has then is . In particular, we know the last face must have an odd number of edges. We also have that . By Euler's formula, we have , and solving for we get , so the last face is a pentagon.    Consider some classic polyhedrons.   An octahedron is a regular polyhedron made up of 8 equilateral triangles (it sort of looks like two pyramids with their bases glued together). Draw a planar graph representation of an octahedron. How many vertices, edges and faces does an octahedron (and your graph) have?    The traditional design of a soccer ball is in fact a (spherical projection of a) truncated icosahedron. This consists of 12 regular pentagons and 20 regular hexagons. No two pentagons are adjacent (so the edges of each pentagon are shared only by hexagons). How many vertices, edges, and faces does a truncated icosahedron have? Explain how you arrived at your answers. Bonus: draw the planar graph representation of the truncated icosahedron.    Your friend claims that he has constructed a convex polyhedron out of 2 triangles, 2 squares, 6 pentagons and 5 octagons. Prove that your friend is lying. Hint: each vertex of a convex polyhedron must border at least three faces.       Prove Euler's formula using induction on the number of edges in the graph.    Let be the statement, every connected planar graph containing edges satisfies . We will show is true for all .  Base case: there is only one graph with zero edges, namely a single isolated vertex. In this case , and , so Euler's formula holds.  Inductive case: Suppose is true for some arbitrary . Now consider an arbitrary graph containing edges (and vertices and faces). No matter what this graph looks like, we can remove a single edge to get a graph with edges which we can apply the inductive hypothesis to.  There are two cases: either the graph contains a cycle or it does not. If the graph contains a cycle, then pick an edge that is part of this cycle, and remove it. This will not disconnect the graph, and will decrease the number of faces by 1 (since the edge was bordering two distinct faces). So by the inductive hypothesis we will have . Adding the edge back will give as needed.  If the graph does not contain a cycle, then it is a tree, so has a vertex of degree 1. Then we can pick the edge to remove to be incident to such a degree 1 vertex. In this case, also remove that vertex. The smaller graph will now satisfy by the induction hypothesis (removing the edge and vertex did not reduce the number of faces). Adding the edge and vertex back gives , as required.  Therefore, by the principle of mathematical induction, Euler's formula holds for all planar graphs.     Prove Euler's formula using induction on the number of vertices in the graph.    Euler's formula ( ) holds for all connected planar graphs. What if a graph is not connected? Suppose a planar graph has two components. What is the value of now?

Edges form the outside of the larger pentagon and the crossing lines of the pentagram. Each vertex of the larger pentagon is adjacent to the closest vertex of the inside pentagram.    What is the length of the shortest cycle? (This quantity is usually called the girth of the graph.)    Prove that any planar graph with vertices and edges satisfies .    We know in any planar graph the number of faces satisfies since each face is bounded by at least three edges, but each edge borders two faces. Combine this with Euler's formula:    .

Finally, every inner vertex is also adjacent to the center vertex.    The girth of the graph is 4.    Explain why we cannot use the same sort of proof we did in to prove that the graph below is not planar. Then explain how you know the graph is not planar anyway.    A graph with 11 vertices.

Edges form the sides of a pentagon for the outer ring of vertices and also the inner ring of vertices. Each outer vertex is also adjacent to two inner vertices: the two on either side of the vertex closest to it. Finally, every inner vertex is also adjacent to the center vertex.    What has happened to the girth? Careful: we have a different number of edges as well. Better check Euler's formula.    "

No matter what this graph looks like, we can remove a single edge to get a graph with edges which we can apply the inductive hypothesis to.  There are two cases: either the graph contains a cycle or it does not. If the graph contains a cycle, then pick an edge that is part of this cycle, and remove it. This will not disconnect the graph, and will decrease the number of faces by 1 (since the edge was bordering two distinct faces). So by the inductive hypothesis we will have .

Even though you can only see some of the vertices, can you deduce whether the graph will have an Euler trail or circuit?    Three vertices. The center vertex is adjacent to the two on either side of it. Each vertex has three dashed edges emanating downward (to illustrate that they go somewhere, but their other endpoints are not shown).        walk  Euler trail  trail Euler  Euler circuit  circuit Euler If we start at a vertex and trace along edges to get to other vertices, we create a walk through the graph. More precisely, a walk in a graph is a sequence of vertices such that every vertex in the sequence is adjacent to the vertices before and after it in the sequence. If the walk travels along every edge exactly once, then the walk is called an Euler trail (or Euler walk or Euler path ). If, in addition, the starting and ending vertices are the same (so you trace along every edge exactly once and end up where you started), then the walk is called an Euler circuit (or Euler tour ). Of course if a graph is not connected, there is no hope of finding such a trail or circuit. For the rest of this section, assume all the graphs discussed are connected.   Königsberg, Seven Bridges of  Seven Bridges of Königsberg The bridges of Königsberg problem is really a question about the existence of Euler paths. There will be a route that crosses every bridge exactly once if and only if the graph below has an Euler trail:    Three vertices aligned in a vertical column left of a single vertex on the right. Edges connect the vertex on the right to each vertex on the left. Among the vertices on the left, two arced edges connect the bottom vertex to the center vertex, and two more connect the center vertex to the top vertex.   This graph is small enough that we could actually check every possible walk that does not reuse edges, and in doing so convince ourselves that there is no Euler trail (let alone an Euler circuit). On small graphs which do have an Euler trail, it is usually not difficult to find one. Our goal is to find a quick way to check whether a graph has an Euler trail or circuit, even if the graph is quite large.  One way to guarantee that a graph does not have an Euler circuit is to include a spike, a vertex of degree 1.    Three vertices in a triangle (with edges connecting them), plus a 4th vertex labeled a adjacent to one of the others.   The vertex has degree 1, and if you try to make an Euler circuit, you see that you will get stuck at the vertex. It is a dead end. That is, unless you start there. But then there is no way to return, so there is no hope of finding an Euler circuit. There is however an Euler trail. It starts at the vertex , then loops around the triangle. You will end at the vertex of degree 3.  You run into a similar problem whenever you have a vertex of any odd degree. If you start at such a vertex, you will not be able to end there (after traversing every edge exactly once). After using one edge to leave the starting vertex, you will be left with an even number of edges emanating from the vertex. Half of these could be used for returning to the vertex, the other half for leaving. So you return, then leave. Return, then leave. The only way to use up all the edges is to use the last one by leaving the vertex. On the other hand, if you have a vertex with odd degree that you do not start a trail at, then you will eventually get stuck at that vertex. The trail will use pairs of edges incident to the vertex to arrive and leave again. Eventually all but one of these edges will be used up, leaving only an edge to arrive by, and none to leave again.  What all this says is that if a graph has an Euler trail and two vertices with odd degree, then the Euler trail must start at one of the odd degree vertices and end at the other. In such a situation, every other vertex must have an even degree since we need an equal number of edges to get to those vertices as to leave them. How could we have an Euler circuit? The graph could not have any odd degree vertex as an Euler trail would have to start there or end there, but not both. Thus for a graph to have an Euler circuit, all vertices must have even degree.  The converse is also true: if all the vertices of a graph have even degree, then the graph has an Euler circuit, and if there are exactly two vertices with odd degree, the graph has an Euler trail. To prove this is a little tricky, but the basic idea is that you will never get stuck because there is an outbound edge for every inbound edge at every vertex. If you try to make an Euler trail and miss some edges, you will always be able to splice in a circuit using the edges you previously missed.   Euler Trails and Circuits  Euler trail  trail Euler  Euler circuit  circuit Euler     A graph has an Euler circuit if and only if the degree of every vertex is even.    A graph has an Euler trail if and only if there are at most two vertices with odd degree.      Since the bridges of Königsberg graph has all four vertices with odd degree, there is no Euler trail through the graph. Thus there is no way for the townspeople to cross every bridge exactly once.    Hamilton Paths   Hamilton path  path Hamilton  Hamilton cycle  cycle Hamilton Suppose you wanted to tour Königsberg in such a way that you visit each land mass (the two islands and both banks) exactly once. This can be done. In graph theory terms, we are asking whether there is a path which visits every vertex exactly once. Such a path is called a Hamilton path (or Hamiltonian path ). We could also consider Hamilton cycles , which are Hamilton paths which start and stop at the same vertex.    Determine whether the graphs below have a Hamilton path.     The Petersen graph: ten vertices arranged in two rings of five each. Each outer vertex is adjacent to the two outer vertices closest to it, forming a pentagon, and to the inner vertex closest to it. Each inner vertex is adjacent to the two inner vertices not neighboring it, forming a 5-ponted star.     A graph with ten vertices. Five vertices form a copy of K5, the complete graph in which each vertex is adjacent to the other four. The remaining five vertices are each adjacent to only one of the five vertices in the copy of K5.      The graph on the left has a Hamilton path (many different ones, actually), as shown here:    The Petersen graph with a highlighted path visiting every vertex exactly once. The path starts at the top outer vertex, proceeds down and two the left to the bottom-left outer vertex, then to the top-left outer vertex, then in and across to the top-right outer vertex, and finally down to the bottom-left outer vertex and up to the bottom-left inner vertex.   The graph on the right does not have a Hamilton path. You would need to visit each of the outside vertices, but as soon as you visit one, you get stuck. Note that this graph does not have an Euler path, although there are graphs with Euler paths but no Hamilton paths.     NP-complete It appears that finding Hamilton paths would be easier because graphs often have more edges than vertices, so there are fewer requirements to be met. However, nobody knows whether this is true. There is no known simple test for whether a graph has a Hamilton path. For small graphs this is not a problem, but as the size of the graph grows, it gets harder and harder to check wither there is a Hamilton path. In fact, this is an example of a question which as far as we know is too difficult for computers to solve; it is an example of a problem which is NP-complete.     Is there a graph that has an Euler circuit but not an Euler trail? Explain your answer.    Can a tree have an Euler tour? Can a tree have an Euler circuit? Explain your answers.

You will visit the nine states below, with the following rather odd rule: you must cross each border between neighboring states exactly once (so, for example, you must cross the Colorado-Utah border exactly once). Can you do it? If so, does it matter where you start your road trip? What fact about graph theory solves this problem?    A map of the United States, with Southwest states highlighted.    This is a question about finding Euler trails. Draw a graph with a vertex in each state, and connect vertices if their states share a border. Exactly two vertices will have odd degree: the vertices for Nevada and Utah. Thus you must start your road trip at in one of those states and end it in the other.

Explain.    Is it possible to tour the house visiting each room exactly once (not necessarily using every doorway)? Explain.    After a few mouse-years, Edward decides to remodel.

  "body": " Coloring    Mapmakers in the fictional land of Euleria have drawn the borders of the various dukedoms of the land. To make the map pretty, they wish to color each region. Adjacent regions must be colored differently, but it is perfectly fine to color two distant regions with the same color. What is the fewest colors the mapmakers can use and still accomplish this task?    An abstract drawing of a \"map\" of regions separated by slightly curved borders. The map contains an outer ring of seven regions (all different sizes), an inner ring of five more regions, and a final odd shaped center region.    Perhaps the most famous graph theory problem is how to color maps.   Given any map of countries, states, counties, etc., how many colors are needed to color each region on the map so that neighboring regions are colored differently?   Actual map makers usually use around seven colors. For one thing, they require watery regions to be a specific color, and with a lot of colors it is easier to find a permissible coloring. We want to know whether there is a smaller palette that will work for any map.  How is this related to graph theory? Well, if we place a vertex in the center of each region (say in the capital of each state) and then connect two vertices if their states share a border, we get a graph. Coloring regions on the map corresponds to coloring the vertices of the graph. Since neighboring regions cannot be colored the same, our graph cannot have vertices colored the same when those vertices are adjacent.   vertex coloring  coloring vertices  graph vertex coloring  chromatic number  graph chromatic number In general, given any graph , a coloring of the vertices is called (not surprisingly) a vertex coloring . If the vertex coloring has the property that adjacent vertices are colored differently, then the coloring is called proper . Every graph has a proper vertex coloring. For example, you could color every vertex with a different color. But often you can do better. The smallest number of colors needed to get a proper vertex coloring is called the chromatic number of the graph, written    the chromatic number of  .    Find the chromatic number of the graphs below.     A copy of K6: six vertices arranged in a hexagon, with every vertex adjacent to every other vertex.     Six vertices arranged in a triangle (with three vertices along each side). Six edges form the outside of the triangle, and three edges connect the center vertices of each side (in an upside-down triangle).     A copy of K2,3, with a row of two vertices on a top row, each adjacent to each of three vertices on a bottom row      The graph on the left is . The only way to properly color the graph is to give every vertex a different color (since every vertex is adjacent to every other vertex). Thus the chromatic number is 6.  The middle graph can be properly colored with just 3 colors (Red, Blue, and Green). For example:    Six vertices arranged in a triangle (with three vertices along each side). Six edges form the outside of the triangle, and three edges connect the center vertices of each side (in an upside-down triangle). The bottom row of vertices are labeled R, B, G (left to right), the middle row of vertices are labeled G, R, and to top vertex is labeled B.   There is no way to color it with just two colors, since there are three vertices mutually adjacent (i.e., a triangle). Thus the chromatic number is 3.  The graph on the right is just . As with all bipartite graphs, this graph has chromatic number 2: color the vertices on the top row red and the vertices on the bottom row blue.    It appears that there is no limit to how large chromatic numbers can get. It should not come as a surprise that has chromatic number . So how could there possibly be an answer to the original map coloring question? If the chromatic number of graph can be arbitrarily large, then it seems like there would be no upper bound to the number of colors needed for any map. But there is.  The key observation is that while it is true that for any number , there is a graph with chromatic number , only some graphs arrive as representations of maps. If you convert a map to a graph, the edges between vertices correspond to borders between the countries. So you should be able to connect vertices in such a way where the edges do not cross. In other words, the graphs representing maps are all planar !  So the question is, what is the largest chromatic number of any planar graph? The answer is the best known theorem of graph theory:   Four Color Theorem  graph chromatic number  planar graph chromatic number of  The Four Color Theorem   If is a planar graph, then the chromatic number of is less than or equal to 4. Thus any map can be properly colored with 4 or fewer colors.    We will not prove this theorem. Really. Even though the theorem is easy to state and understand, the proof is not. In fact, there is currently no easy known proof of the theorem. The current best proof still requires powerful computers to check an unavoidable set of 633 reducible configurations . The idea is that every graph must contain one of these reducible configurations (this fact also needs to be checked by a computer) and that reducible configurations can, in fact, be colored in 4 or fewer colors.    Coloring in General   The math department plans to offer 10 classes next semester. Some classes cannot run at the same time (perhaps they are taught by the same professor, or are required for seniors).       Class:  Conflicts with:    A  D I    B  D I J    C  E F I    D  A B F    E  C H I    F  C D I    G  J    H  E I J    I  A B C E F H    J  B G H     How many different time slots are needed to teach these classes (and which should be taught at the same time)? More importantly, how could we use graph coloring to answer this question?   Cartography is certainly not the only application of graph coloring. There are plenty of situations in which you might wish to partition the objects in question so that related objects are not in the same set. For example, you might wish to store chemicals safely. To avoid explosions, certain pairs of chemicals should not be stored in the same room. By coloring a graph (with vertices representing chemicals and edges representing potential negative interactions), you can determine the smallest number of rooms needed to store the chemicals.  Here is a further example:    Radio stations broadcast their signal at certain frequencies. However, there are a limited number of frequencies to choose from, so nationwide many stations use the same frequency. This works because the stations are far enough apart that their signals will not interfere; no one radio could pick them up at the same time.  Suppose 10 new radio stations are to be set up in a currently unpopulated (by radio stations) region. The radio stations that are close enough to each other to cause interference are recorded in the table below. What is the fewest number of frequencies the stations could use.        KQEA KQEB KQEC KQED KQEE  KQEF  KQEG KQEH  KQEI KQEJ   KQEA x x x x  KQEB x x  KQEC x x x x  KQED x x x x  KQEE x x  KQEF x x x x x  KQEG x x x x  KQEH x x  KQEI x x x  KQEJ  x x  x x  x      Represent the problem as a graph with vertices as the stations and edges when two stations are close enough to cause interference. We are looking for the chromatic number of the graph. Vertices that are colored identically represent stations that can have the same frequency.  This graph has chromatic number 5. A proper 5-coloring is shown on the right. Notice that the graph contains a copy of the complete graph so no fewer than 5 colors can be used.     A drawing of the graph representing the radio stations with edges between vertices if those radio stations interfere with each other. Vertices are arranged in a ring with KQEA at the top, and proceeding clockwise to KQEB, and so on through KQEH.     A drawing of the graph representing the radio stations with edges between vertices if those radio stations interfere with each other. Here each vertex is labeled with a letter representing a color. From the top vertex and moving around clockwise: R, G, B, B, G, G, Y, R, B, P. A copy of of the graph K5 is drawn in bold among the edges of the original graph.      In the example above, the chromatic number was 5, but this is not a counterexample to the Four Color Theorem , since the graph representing the radio stations is not planar. It would be nice to have some quick way to find the chromatic number of a (possibly non-planar) graph. It turns out nobody knows whether an efficient algorithm for computing chromatic numbers exists.  While we might not be able to find the exact chromatic number of graph easily, we can often give a reasonable range for the chromatic number. In other words, we can give upper and lower bounds for chromatic number.  This is actually not very difficult: for every graph , the chromatic number of is at least 1 and at most the number of vertices of .  What? You want better bounds on the chromatic number? Well you are in luck.   clique  graph clique A clique in a graph is a set of vertices all of which are pairwise adjacent. In other words, a clique of size is just a copy of the complete graph . We define the clique number of a graph to be the largest for which the graph contains a clique of size . Any clique of size cannot be colored with fewer than colors, so we have a nice lower bound:    The chromatic number of a graph is at least the clique number of .     perfect graph  graph perfect  chordal graph  graph chordal There are times when the chromatic number of is equal to the clique number. These graphs have a special name; they are called perfect . If you know that a graph is perfect, then finding the chromatic number is simply a matter of searching for the largest clique. There are special classes of graphs which can be proved to be perfect. One such class is the set of chordal graphs, which have the property that every cycle in the graph contains a chord an edge between two vertices in of the cycle which are not adjacent in the cycle. However, not all graphs are perfect.   maximum degree  graph maximum degree  degree maximum For an upper bound, we can improve on the number of vertices by looking to the degrees of vertices. Let    the maximum degree in  be the largest degree of any vertex in the graph . One reasonable guess for an upper bound on the chromatic number is . Why is this reasonable? Starting with any vertex, it together with all of its neighbors can always be colored in colors, since at most we are talking about vertices in this set. Now fan out! At any point, if you consider an already colored vertex, some of its neighbors might be colored, some might not. But no matter what, that vertex and its neighbors could all be colored distinctly, since there are at most neighbors, plus the one vertex being considered.  In fact, there are examples of graphs for which . For any , the complete graph has chromatic number , but (since every vertex is adjacent to every other vertex). Additionally, any odd cycle will have chromatic number 3, but the degree of every vertex in a cycle is 2. It turns out that these are the only two types of examples where we get equality, a result known as Brooks' Theorem.   Brooks' Theorem  Brooks' Theorem   Any graph satisfies , unless is a complete graph or an odd cycle, in which case .    The proof of this theorem is just complicated enough that we will not present it here (although you are asked to prove a special case in the exercises). The adventurous reader is encouraged to find a book on graph theory for suggestions on how to prove the theorem.    coloring edges  Coloring Edges   chromatic index  graph chromatic index The chromatic number of a graph tells us about coloring vertices, but we could also ask about coloring edges. Just like with vertex coloring, we might insist that edges that are adjacent must be colored differently. Here, we are thinking of two edges as being adjacent if they are incident to the same vertex. The least number of colors required to properly color the edges of a graph is called the chromatic index of , written    the chromatic index of  .    Six friends decide to spend the afternoon playing chess. Everyone will play everyone else once. They have plenty of chess sets but nobody wants to play more than one game at a time. Games will last an hour (thanks to their handy chess clocks). How many hours will the tournament last?    Represent each player with a vertex and put an edge between two players if they will play each other. In this case, we get the graph :    The graph K6: six vertices (arranged in a circle), each adjacent to the other five.   We must color the edges; each color represents a different hour. Since different edges incident to the same vertex will be colored differently, no player will be playing two different games (edges) at the same time. Thus we need to know the chromatic index of .  Notice that for sure , since there is a vertex of degree 5. It turns out 5 colors is enough (go find such a coloring). Therefore the friends will play for 5 hours.    Interestingly, if one of the friends in the above example left, the remaining 5 chess-letes would still need 5 hours: the chromatic index of is also 5.  In general, what can we say about chromatic index? Certainly . But how much higher could it be? Only a little higher.   Vizing's Theorem  Vizing's Theorem   For any graph , the chromatic index is either or .    At first this theorem makes it seem like chromatic index might not be very interesting. However, deciding which case a graph is in is not always easy. Graphs for which are called class 1 , while the others are called class 2 . Bipartite graphs always satisfy , so are class 1 (this was proved by König in 1916, decades before Vizing proved his theorem in 1964). In 1965 Vizing proved that all planar graphs with are of class 1, but this does not hold for all planar graphs with . Vizing conjectured that all planar graphs with or are class 1; the case was proved in 2001 by Sanders and Zhao; the case is still open.   Ramsey theory  Ramsey Theory  There is another interesting way we might consider coloring edges, quite different from what we have discussed so far. What if we colored every edge of a graph either red or blue. Can we do so without, say, creating a monochromatic  monochromatic triangle (i.e., an all red or all blue triangle)? Certainly for some graphs the answer is yes. Try doing so for . What about ? ? How far can we go?  The problem above is not too difficult and is a fun exercise. We could extend the question in a variety of ways. What if we had three colors? What if we were trying to avoid other graphs. Surprisingly, very little is known about these questions. For example, we know that you need to go up to in order to force a monochromatic triangle using three colors, but nobody knows how big you need to go with more colors. Similarly, we know that using two colors is the smallest graph that forces a monochromatic copy of , but the best we have to force a monochromatic is a range, somewhere from to . If you are interested in these sorts of questions, this area of graph theory is called Ramsey theory. Check it out.      True of false: if a graph contains a vertex of degree 5, then the chromatic number of the graph is at least 5. Explain.    In your own words, explain the difference between chromatic number and chromatic index.     Practice Problems    Each of the following problems can be solved by finding either the chromatic number of a graph or the chromatic index of a graph.  For each problem, say whether you should find a proper coloring of the vertices or of the edges of the graph to solve the problem. Note: you likely don't have enough information to actually solve the problem, but this is okay. Just say in principle whether this is an edge-coloring or vertex-coloring application.    5 students will interview with 4 companies for internships at a job fair. How many time slots are needed for interviews?

How many cabinates are required?    The math department wants to schedule common, day-long midterm exams over Spring Break, but obviously a student in two classes has to have their exams for those classes on different days (but this is the only problem with this plan). How many days are needed for exams?           What is the chromatic number of each graph?                                            What is the chromatic index of each graph?                                            The following statements are about the chromatic number and the chromatic index of graphs. We use for the maximum degree of .  Are the following statements true or false?    In any bipartite graph , .    The chromatic index of any planar graph is at most 4.    For all , .    For all , .           What is the chromatic number of each graph?                                               Additional Exercises   What is the smallest number of colors you need to properly color the vertices of ? That is, find the chromatic number of the graph.   2, since the graph is bipartite. One color for the top set of vertices, another color for the bottom set of vertices.    Draw a graph with chromatic number 6 (i.e., which requires 6 colors to properly color the vertices). Could your graph be planar? Explain.   For example, . If the chromatic number is 6, then the graph is not planar; the 4-color theorem states that all planar graphs can be colored with 4 or fewer colors.    Find the chromatic number of each of the following graphs.     A graph with five vertices arranged in a diamond with one vertex in the middle. The top vertex is connected to the two outside vertices below it, which are connected to the bottom vertex. The center vertex is connected to the two vertices to its left and right.     The graph C7: seven vertices arranged in a circle with edges connecting neighboring vertices (creating a 7-sided polygon).     Five vertices in a pentagon with a sixth vertex in the center. Edges form the outside of the pentagon, and the center vertex is adjacent to each outside vertex.       The graph K5: five vertices each adjacent to all the others, arranged in a pentagon.     The Petersen graph: ten vertices arranged in two rings of five each. Each outer vertex is adjacent to the two outer vertices closest to it, forming a pentagon, and to the inner vertex closest to it. Each inner vertex is adjacent to the two inner vertices not neighboring it, forming a 5-ponted star.     The chromatic numbers are 2, 3, 4, 5, and 3 respectively from left to right.    A group of 10 friends decides to head up to a cabin in the woods (where nothing could possibly go wrong). Unfortunately, a number of these friends have dated each other in the past, and things are still a little awkward. To get to the cabin, they need to divide up into some number of cars, and no two people who dated should be in the same car.   What is the smallest number of cars you need if all the relationships were strictly heterosexual? Represent an example of such a situation with a graph. What kind of graph do you get?    Because a number of these friends dated there are also conflicts between friends of the same gender, listed below. Now what is the smallest number of conflict-free cars they could take to the cabin?     Friend  A  B  C  D  E  F  G  H  I  J    Conflicts  CFJ  J  AEF  H  CFG  ACEGI  EFI  D  AFG  B          What is the smallest number of colors that can be used to color the vertices of a cube so that no two adjacent vertices are colored identically?   The cube can be represented as a planar graph and colored with two colors as follows:    Eight vertices forming a inner and outer square (with edges forming the sides of each square), with edges connecting each inner vertex to its closest outer vertex neighbor. The outer vertices are labeled R, B, R, B (starting at the top left and moving clockwise). The inner vertices are labeled B, R, B, R (starting at the top left and moving clockwise).   Since it would be impossible to color the vertices with a single color, we see that the cube has chromatic number 2 (it is bipartite).    Prove the chromatic number of any tree is two. Recall, a tree is a connected graph with no cycles.   Describe a procedure to color the tree below.    A tree with 28 vertices.     The chromatic number of is two when is even. What goes wrong when is odd?    Prove that your procedure from part (a) always works for any tree.    Now, prove using induction that every tree has chromatic number 2.      graph coloring vertices vs edges coloring vertices vs edges  The two problems below can be solved using graph coloring. For each problem, represent the situation with a graph, say whether you should be coloring vertices or edges and why, and use the coloring to solve the problem.   Your Quidditch league has 5 teams. You will play a tournament next week in which every team will play every other team once. Each team can play at most one match each day, but there is plenty of time in the day for multiple matches. What is the fewest number of days over which the tournament can take place?    Ten members of Math Club are driving to a math conference in a neighboring state. However, some of these students have dated in the past, and things are still a little awkward. Each student lists which other students they refuse to share a car with; these conflicts are recorded in the table below. What is the fewest number of cars the club needs to make the trip? Do not worry about running out of seats, just avoid the conflicts.     Student:  A  B  C  D  E  F  G  H  I  J    Conflicts:  BEJ  ADG  HJ  BF  AI  DJ  B  CI  EHJ  ACFI         For (a), you will want the teams to be vertices and games to be edges. Which does it make sense to color?   six color theorem  Prove the 6-color theorem: every planar graph has chromatic number 6 or less. Do not assume the 4-color theorem (whose proof is MUCH harder), but you may assume the fact that every planar graph contains a vertex of degree at most 5.   graph perfect perfect graph  Not all graphs are perfect. Give an example of a graph with chromatic number 4 that does not contain a copy of . That is, there should be no 4 vertices all pairwise adjacent.   The wheel graph below has this property. The outside of the wheel forms an odd cycle, so requires 3 colors, the center of the wheel must be different than all the outside vertices.    Five vertices in a pentagon with a sixth vertex in the center. Edges form the outside of the pentagon, and the center vertex is adjacent to each outside vertex.     Find the chromatic number of the graph below and prove you are correct.    A graph with 11 vertices. A single vertex in the center, then five vertices equally spaced around a ring around it, and five more equally spaced around a ring around those. Edges form the sides of a pentagon for the outer ring of vertices. Each outer vertex is also adjacent to two inner vertices: the two on either side of the vertex closest to it. Finally, every inner vertex is also adjacent to the center vertex.    The chromatic number is 4. Now prove this!  Note that you cannot use the 4-color theorem, or Brooke's theorem, or the clique number here. In fact, this graph, called the Grötzsch graph is the smallest graph with chromatic number 4 that does not contain any triangles.    Prove by induction on vertices that any graph which contains at least one vertex of degree less than (the maximal degree of all vertices in ) has chromatic number at most .    You have a set of magnetic alphabet letters (one of each of the 26 letters in the alphabet) that you need to put into boxes. For obvious reasons, you don't want to put two consecutive letters in the same box. What is the fewest number of boxes you need (assuming the boxes are able to hold as many letters as they need to)?   If we drew a graph with each letter representing a vertex, and each edge connecting two letters that were consecutive in the alphabet, we would have a graph containing two vertices of degree 1 (A and Z) and the remaining 24 vertices all of degree 2 (for example, would be adjacent to both and ). By Brooks' theorem, this graph has chromatic number at most 2, as that is the maximal degree in the graph and the graph is not a complete graph or odd cycle. Thus only two boxes are needed.    Suppose you colored edges of a graph either red or blue (not requiring that adjacent edges be colored differently). What must be true of the graph to guarantee some vertex is incident to three edges of the same color? Prove your answer.   You can color in such a way that every vertex is adjacent to exactly two blue edges and two red edges. However, there is a graph with only 5 edges that will result in a vertex incident to three edges of the same color no matter how they are colored. What is it, and how can you generalize?       Prove that if you color every edge of either red or blue, you are guaranteed a monochromatic triangle (that is, an all red or an all blue triangle).   The previous exercise is useful as a starting point.    "

  "body": " Relations and Graphs   Relations Generally  A graph is a way to represent some ways that different objects are related. We have seen how to use graphs to represent which people are friends, or which classes have time conflicts, or which radio stations are too close to have the same frequency. Not all ways in which things can be related can be represented by a graph, however. In this section we will consider the more general concept of a relation and see how those might be related to graphs.  Consider the example of the relation between students and classes that holds when a student is in that class (in a particular semester). This is a relation between two different sets (the students and the classes). If we used a graph to illustrate this relation, the graph would be bipartite , since two students are never related to each other, and two classes are never related to each other.  A graph is really a set of vertices and a set of edges: ; each element of the set is a two-element subset of . If we want to draw attention to the bipartiteness of the graph, we can split up into its two sets and write . In this notation, for the graph to be bipartite, we want each edge to be a pair where is an element of and is an element of . In other words, each edge is an element of the Cartesian product of and , written, (Another way to say this is that is the set of all ordered pairs of elements from and . )   There is one subtlety here we should point out: the bipartite graph we have described really has directed edges from to since we are considering ordered pairs. Our definition of a graph has edges as two-element subsets of vertices, and subsets are not ordered. As long as and are disjoint sets, there is no confusion here, but we see relations in which and share some elements, but we still care about the order. More on that soon.   This example exactly illustrates what a general binary relation is. Here is the careful definition.    A binary relation is a set of ordered pairs. We say the binary relation is a relation on sets and provided the ordered pairs are a subset of . We say a binary relation is a relation on a set provided the ordered pairs are a subset of .    Note that is just the set of all ordered pairs where both coordinates are elements from .    Consider a set of students and a set of classes. Say and . Everyone except Dirk is in Calculus, Bob and Eva are in Discrete, and Al, Cat, and Dirk are in Statistics.  We can define a relation of is taking  and that holds of a student and class precisely if that student is taking that class. Write this relation as a subset of and draw its bipartite graph.    To write the relation precisely, we just give the set of ordered pairs: We can draw this relation as a bipartite graph:   A bipartite graph representing the \"is taking\" relation.        Consider the relation for is a multiple of on the set . Write this as a set of ordered pairs. Does this relation create a graph?    First, let's think about which elements should be related and which should not. We know that is a multiple of , so the relation is true of the pair , but is not a multiple of , so the pair does not satisfy the relation. More precisely, we we say that but .  Let's list all the elements of : This relation is not a graph for two reasons: first, elements are related to themselves, and second, the order of elements in the relation is not symmetric ( is related to , but is not related to , for example).  We can, however, still draw something like a graph to illustrate this relation: Since the direction of the relation matters, we will have directed edges. This alone would create a directed graph . Since vertices can have edges going to themselves, we would call the structure a multigraph , so the relation can be thought of as a directed multigraph    A directed multigraph for the relation \"is a multiple of\" on the set 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6      A binary relation on sets and can always be turned around to give a relation on sets and . That is, says how things in are related to things in ; those things in are related to things in , just in a inverse (backwards) way. We will call this new relation the inverse of .    Given a binary relation , define to be the inverse of as the set .    The relation from said that a given student was in a particular class. The inverse relation says that a given class has a particular student in it. For example, is an element of . Graphically, there won't be any difference in the picture, although we could put the set of classes on top and students on bottom.  The relation from game us that, for example, is a multiple of , since . For the inverse, we have , which means that is a factor of . For this example, we have represented a relation as a directed multigraph. The graph of the inverse will look exactly the same, but with all the arrows will point in the opposite direction.  Another way to create a new relation is to combine two relations. Suppose in addition to the is taking relation from , we define a relation is taught by that matches up each course with its instructor. Perhaps Professor X teaches Calculus. In that case, since Al is taking Calculus, and Calculus is taught by Professor X, we can conclude that Al is taking a class with Professor X.    Let be a relation from set to and be a relation from to . The composition of and is     Note the order in which we wrote the two relations: it's , not . The reason we do this (which might seem backward) is that it agrees with the usual notation for composition of functions . In fact, functions are nothing but a specific type of relation!    Write out the relation , composing the relations of and . Note that here we are saying the the statistic course is co-taught by professors X and S.    The relation we are looking for is a relation between students and professors. We can start with each element of , and extend it by following the course to the professor(s) via . So for example, start with Cat, and notice that . Now look at what Calculus is related to via : . Thus we can push these together to conclude that .  An alternative approach would be to simply consider which pairs of students and professors are linked by a common class. Should the pair be an element of the composition? No, because there is no class that is both taken by Al and taught by Professor L. On the other hand, we can conclude the since there is a common course. In fact, the common course could be Calculus or Statistics (it doesn't matter how many common middle steps there are, as long as there is at least one).  Here is the complete relation:     Something interesting often happens when you compose a relation with its inverse. You might have seen something like this for functions in calculus or algebra: has an inverse function , and we know that . But functions are relations in which every input has exactly one output , so perhaps it is not surprising that composing with an inverse just gives you the identity function. When inputs can have multiple outputs, and outputs can have multiple inputs, then we get something more.    Describe the relation (using our familiar relation from ). What does this tell us about students and classes?    By following the relation, we could start by saying Al is in Calculus, and Calculus is taken by Al, so Al is related to Al. But also , Calculus is taken by Bob, so now Al is also related to Bob. Is Bob related to Al as well? Yes, since Bob is taking Calculus and Calculus is taken by Al.  The composition is telling us which pairs of students have at least one class in common. That's almost all pairs of students, except that Dirk is not related to Bob or Eva, since they don't take Statistics, and that is the only class he takes.  Instead of writing out the relation (which will almost be all of ), here is the graph representation.   The graph representing the composition of T and its inverse.    While we drew a directed multigraph here, the arrows going both ways mean that we really could have drawn just a multigraph.      Properties of Relations  From this point on, we will just consider relations on a single set (so from a set to itself). To help understand these relations, let's consider some basic properties a relation might or might not have.   Reflexive, Symmetric, and Transitive   Ler be a relation on the set . We say,    is reflexive provided for all .     is symmetric provided, for all , if then .     is transitive provided, for all , if and , then .       Let's examine each of these properties carefully.  It will be helpful to consider a few standard examples of relations on sets as we go. Most relations we consider here will be written using infix notation, just meaning that we put the relation symbol between the two things it is relating. For example, the less than relation is almost always written as rather than writing .   Reflexive and non-reflexive relations  A relation is reflexive when every element is related to itself. The following are reflexive relations:   The less-that-or-equal-to relation on any set of numbers. Is it the case that ? More importantly, is every number no greater than itself? Since the answer is yes, this relation is reflexive    The within 3 relation, that holds of two numbers and provided . To prove that this is reflexive, we simply note that .    The is a multiple of relation from . Note that the directed multigraph for this relation had loops at every vertex.     However, these relations are not reflexive:   The sums to zero relation, that holds on numbers and if . Note that while , so is an element of the relation, every other number is not related to itself.    Any relation that is described by a graph. Remember, graphs cannot have edges looping back to a single vertex, so the edge relation on a graph is not reflexive. (A multigraph could be reflexive or not).      If no element is related to itself (such as in the edge relation for a graph), then we call the relation irreflexive . Of course, there are relations that are neither reflexive nor irreflexive.  Checking that a relation is reflexive is relatively easy. The other two properties are phrased as implications, which makes them a little more complex.   Symmetric and non-symmetric relations  Essentially, symmetric relations are the ones that work both ways. More precisely, if is related to , then is also related to .  The following relations are symmetric.   The within 3 relation: if then .    The sums to zero relation: if , then certainly .    For any graph, the edge relation is symmetric. Of course, for directed graphs this is usually not true.     On the other hand, these relations are not symmetric.    is not symmetric. All we need to do to prove that a relation is not symmetric is to find some and such that ut . Well, , but . QED.    The is a multiple of relation is not symmetric. is a multiple of but is not a multiple of .      Relations that are not symmetric could in fact by antisymmetric , meaning the only elements for which both and are in the relation is when . Note that there are relations that are neither symmetric nor antisymmetric.  Using the language of inverse relations, a relation is symmetric if and only if the relation is equal to its inverse.   Transitive and non-transitive relations  If is related to , and is related to , does that mean is related to ? If this is true no matter what , , and are, then we say the relation is transitive.  Here are some transitive relations.    . Suppose and . Then clearly .    The is a multiple of relation. This is a good one to write a proof for: Suppose is a multiple of and that is a multiple of . Then for some integer and for some integer . By substitution, , so is a multiple of .     However, the following relations are not transitive.   The within 3 relation is not transitive. All we need to do is find three numbers that fail to meet the condition. How about , , and . Here is within 3 of , and is within 3 of , but so the relation does not hold of .    The sums to zero relation is not transitive. Notice that we never claimed that , , and need to be different numbers. Let , and . Then and , so the relation holds of and . But so the relation does not hold of .     The edge relation for a graph might or might not be transitive. What would a graph look like if its edge relation was transitive?     Equivalence Relations  Now we will do something very typical for mathematics: we will look at our most common types of relations, consider what properties these have, and then classify other relations that also have these properties as a specific class of relations.  The relation we are all most familiar with is equality . Which properties of relations does the equality relation possess? Certainly everything is equal to itself, so equality is reflexive . If , then , so equality is symmetric . If and , then , so equality is transitive .  What other relations are all three of reflexive , symmetric , and transitive ? Exactly those relations that behave like equality. We call such relations equivalence relations .   Equivalence Relation   A relation that is reflexive, symmetric, and transitive is called an equivalence relation .     Another example of a type of relation that is modeled after a classic relation is a partial order . This is a relation that is reflexive, antisymmetric , and transitive, just like less-than-or-equal-to. Perhaps you noticed already that the subset relation, written feels a lot like . This is because is also a partial order. So is the is a multiple of relation we saw above.  There are lots of interesting things we can say about partial orders and the sets they partially order, called partially ordered sets or PoSets . Another time.   None of the examples we have considered so far in this section have been equivalence relations, but they are ubiquitous in mathematics. They are so common, it is easy to overlook them as anything worth saying something about at all. Let's see some examples.    Prove that the relation , which holds of two integers if their difference is even, is an equivalence relation. That is, if and only if for some integer .    We simply check the three required properties.    is reflexive: for any integer , we have and for , so .     is symmetric: Fix arbitrary integers and , and assume . That means that for some integer . What about ? Well, we will have , and is an integer, so we have .     is transitive: Fix arbitrary integers , , and and assume and . This means that and for some integers and . What about ? Well, . Since is an integer, we see that as required.         Let's call two graphs degree-sequence-equivalent if they have the same degree sequence. Is this an equivalence relation?    Yes it is. Clearly every graph has the same degree sequence as itself, so the relation is reflexive. If has the same degree sequence as , then has the same degree sequence as , so the relation is transitive. Finally, if has the same degree sequence as , which has the same degree sequence as , then they all have the same degree sequence, so has the same degree sequence as (i.e., the relation is transitive).    This example is almost too obvious. That's because we said that two things are related if a well-defined property of those things was equal , and that equality is of course satisfies the properties of an equivalence relation. Our next goal is to try to make better sense of this and see that it is exactly what gives us an equivalence relation.    Equivalence Classes and Partitions  Give any relation , we can look at the set of elements that are related to a given element. For the is taking relation, we can ask what classes is Al taking (i.e., the classes related to Al). For the is a multiple of , we can ask which numbers is 6 a multiple of. then one way to study the relation is to study the sets of thing related to each element.    Let be a relation on the set and let be an element of . The relation class of , written is the set of all elements such that (the set of that are related to by ). That is, .  When is an equivalence relation, we call relation classes equivalence classes .      Find the relation classes for the is a multiple of relation on the set .    There will be six relation classes, since each element has a relation class. They are: For example, we found by considering all pairs that satisfied the relation: 4 is a multiple of 1, 2, and 4, so those are the possible values of that we find.  Look back at the directed multigraph for this relation shown in the solution to . What are the relation classes? They are nothing but the neighbors of each vertex (where neighbor means you follow the arrows in the correct direction).      Find the equivalence classes for the relation on the integers.    On no! Our set is infinite, so we will have infinitely many relation classes? Well, we better get started...  What numbers are related to 1? Remember, we want integers whose difference with 1 is a multiple of 2. So 3 for sure. Also 5, and 7, and -1, and -3, and... all the odds? Yes, because the difference of any two odd numbers is even. We can also say that the difference between any two even numbers is even, so the equivalence class of 2 will contain all the even numbers. So far we have:   Actually, I think we are done. While , , , and so on are all completely valid equivalence classes, the elements that are related to will be exactly the elements related to , since . This is because the relation is transitive! If , then we know .  So we have exactly two equivalence classes. Every integer is in exactly one of these two equivalence classes, and the equivalence class of any integer is exactly the class it belongs to.    Examine the two examples above carefully. For the is a multiple of relation, which is NOT an equivalence relation, the some elements belong to more than one (different) relation class. But for , which is an equivalence relation, every element is in exactly one equivalence class. This is no accident. To make sense of this, we will define a new term.    Given a non-empty set , a partition of is a set of non-empty subsets of such that every element of is in exactly one element of .    That definition has a lot of symbols and sets involved. It's really not complicated though: a partition is a way to break up a set into disjoint subsets that cover the whole set. That the subsets are disjoint means no element is in more than one subset. That the subsets cover the set means every element is in at least one subset.    Give a few different partitions of the set .    There are so many choices here! One choice is: . That's a partition of into two subsets. Another partition: . Another: , which happens to be a partition into even and odd numbers. We also have the trivial partition: . Note that is a single set inside the set .    It is sometimes a little confusing the think of the elements of a partition as subsets since the partition is a set, and a set of sets can be difficult to talk about. We sometimes call the partition a collection and each of the elements of the partition parts or blocks .  Now the big idea: for any equivalence relation, the equivalence classes form a partition, and for any partition, we can define a relation are in the same subset which will be an equivalence relation. We have already seen that the equivalence classes of form a partition. Let's go the other direction.    Define an equivalence relation on the set from the partition .    Say two elements of are equivalent provided they belong to the same element of . That is, and , and , , , , , and . Wait, we also have , , and so on, since every number is in the same subset as itself.  It is clear from looking that this relation is reflexive, symmetric, and transitive, so is an equivalence relation.      Given any equivalence relation on a set , the equivalence classes form a partition of .  Given any partition of a set , the relation defined by if and only if and belong to the same block of , is an equivalence relation.  Further, the equivalence classes for the equivalence relation formed by a partition are exactly the original partition, and the equivalence relation built by the partition of its equivalence classes is exactly the original equivalence relation.       Consider the relation defined on the integers that holds of and precisely if . So for example, but .

  "body": " Matching in Bipartite Graphs   matching    graph  matching    perfect matching  matching   marriage problem matching   Given a bipartite graph, a matching is a subset of the edges for which every vertex belongs to exactly one of the edges. Our goal in this activity is to discover some criterion for when a bipartite graph has a matching.  Does the graph below contain a matching? If so, find one.    A bipartite graph with 12 vertices, in two sets of six. If we call the top vertices a0 through a5, and the bottom vertices b0 to b5 (left to right), then the graph has the following edges: (a0,b0), (a0,b1), (a0,b5), (a1,b0), (a1,b3), (a2,b1), (a2,b2), (a2,b3), (a3,b0), (a3,b5), (a4,b2), (a4,b3), (a4,b4), (a4,b5), (a5,b4).   Not all bipartite graphs have matchings. Draw as many fundamentally different examples of bipartite graphs which do NOT have matchings. Your goal is to find all the possible obstructions to a graph having a perfect matching. Write down the necessary conditions for a graph to have a matching (that is, fill in the blank: If a graph has a matching, then ). Then ask yourself whether these conditions are sufficient (is it true that if , then the graph has a matching?).   We conclude with one more example of a graph theory problem to illustrate the variety and vastness of the subject.   matching  graph matching Suppose you have a bipartite graph . This will consist of two sets of vertices and with some edges connecting some vertices of to some vertices in (but of course, no edges between two vertices both in or both in ). A matching of is a subset of the edges for which each vertex of belongs to exactly one edge of the subset, and no vertex in belongs to more than one edge in the subset. In practice we will assume that (the two sets have the same number of vertices) so this says that every vertex in the graph belongs to exactly one edge in the matching. Note: what we are calling a matching is sometimes called a perfect matching or complete matching . This is because in it interesting to look at non-perfect matchings as well. We will call those partial matchings.  Some context might make this easier to understand. Think of the vertices in as representing students in a class, and the vertices in as representing presentation topics. We put an edge from a vertex to a vertex if student would like to present on topic . Of course, some students would want to present on more than one topic, so their vertex would have degree greater than 1. As the teacher, you want to assign each student their own unique topic. Thus you want to find a matching of : you pick some subset of the edges so that each student gets matched up with exactly one topic, and no topic gets matched to two students. The standard example for matchings used to be the marriage problem in which consisted of the men in the town, the women, and an edge represented a marriage that was agreeable to both parties. A matching then represented a way for the town elders to marry off everyone in the town, no polygamy allowed. We have chosen a more progressive context for the sake of political correctness.  The question is: when does a bipartite graph contain a matching of ? To begin to answer this question, consider what could prevent the graph from containing a matching. This will not necessarily tell us a condition when the graph does have a matching, but at least it is a start.  One way could not have a matching is if there is a vertex in not adjacent to any vertex in (so having degree 0). What else? What if two students both like the same one topic, and no others? Then after assigning that one topic to the first student, there is nothing left for the second student to like, so it is very much as if the second student has degree 0. Or what if three students like only two topics between them. Again, after assigning one student a topic, we reduce this down to the previous case of two students liking only one topic. We can continue this way with more and more students.   It should be clear at this point that if there is every a group of students who as a group like or fewer topics, then no matching is possible. This is true for any value of , and any group of students.   neighbors of vertices  graph neighbors To make this more graph-theoretic, say you have a set of vertices. Define    the set of neighbors of .  to be the set of all the neighbors of vertices in . That is, contains all the vertices (in ) which are adjacent to at least one of the vertices in . (In the student\/topic graph, is the set of topics liked by the students of .) Our discussion above can be summarized as follows:   Matching Condition  matching condition  graph matching  neighbors of verties  graph neighbors  If a bipartite graph has a matching of , then for all .   Is the converse true? Suppose satisfies the matching condition for all (every set of vertices has at least as many neighbors than vertices in the set). Does that mean that there is a matching? Surprisingly, yes. The obvious necessary condition is also sufficient. This happens often in graph theory. If you can avoid the obvious counterexamples, you often get what you want. This is a theorem first proved by Philip Hall in 1935. There is also an infinite version of the theorem which was proved by Marshal Hall, Jr. The name is a coincidence though as the two Halls are not related.   Hall's Marriage Theorem  Hall's Marriage Theorem  matching condition  graph matching  neighbors of vertices  graph neighbors   Let be a bipartite graph with sets and . Then has a matching of if and only if for all .    There are quite a few different proofs of this theorem a quick internet search will get you started.  In addition to its application to marriage and student presentation topics, matchings have applications all over the place. We conclude with one such example.    Suppose you deal 52 regular playing cards into 13 piles of 4 cards each. Prove that you can always select one card from each pile to get one of each of the 13 card values Ace, 2, 3, , 10, Jack, Queen, and King.    Doing this directly would be difficult, but we can use the matching condition to help. Construct a graph with 13 vertices in the set , each representing one of the 13 card values, and 13 vertices in the set , each representing one of the 13 piles. Draw an edge between a vertex to a vertex if a card with value is in the pile . Notice that we are just looking for a matching of ; each value needs to be found in the piles exactly once.  We will have a matching if the matching condition holds. Given any set of card values (a set ) we must show that . That is, the number of piles that contain those values is at least the number of different values. But what if it wasn't? Say . If , then we would have fewer than different cards in those piles (since each pile contains 4 cards). But there are cards with the different values, so at least one of these cards must be in another pile, a contradiction. Thus the matching condition holds, so there is a matching, as required.      Find a matching of the bipartite graphs below or explain why no matching exists.     A bipartite graph with six vertices, in two sets of three. If we call the top vertices a,b,c, and the bottom vertices 1, 2, 3 (left to right), then the graph has the following edges: (a,1), (a,2), (b,1), (b,3), (c,1), (c,3).     A bipartite graph with eight vertices, in two sets of four. If we call the top vertices a,b,c,d and the bottom vertices 1, 2, 3,4 (left to right), then the graph has the following edges: (a,1), (a,3), (a,4) (b,2), (c,1), (c,2), (c,3), (c,4), (d,2).     A bipartite graph with ten vertices, in two sets of five. If we call the top vertices a,b,c,d,e and the bottom vertices 1, 2, 3,4,5 (left to right), then the graph has the following edges: (a,1), (a,2), (a,3), (b,1), (b,3), (c,2), (c,4), (d,3), (d,5), (e,3), (e,4), (e,5).     The first and third graphs have a matching, shown in bold (there are other matchings as well). The middle graph does not have a matching. If you look at the three circled vertices, you see that they only have two neighbors, which violates the matching condition (the three circled vertices form the set ).     A bipartite graph with six vertices, in two sets of three. If we call the top vertices a,b,c, and the bottom vertices 1, 2, 3 (left to right), then the graph has the following edges: (a,1), (a,2), (b,1), (b,3), (c,1), (c,3).

Of these, the following edges are highlighted bold: (a,1), (b,3), (c,2), (d,5), (e,4).     partial matching matching partial  A bipartite graph that doesn't have a matching might still have a partial matching . By this we mean a set of edges for which no vertex belongs to more than one edge (but possibly belongs to none). Every bipartite graph (with at least one edge) has a partial matching, so we can look for the largest partial matching in a graph.  Your friend claims that she has found the largest partial matching for the graph below (her matching is in bold). She explains that no other edge can be added, because all the edges not used in her partial matching are connected to matched vertices. Is she correct?    A bipartite graph with ten vertices in two sets of five. Call the top vertices a, b, c, d, e and the bottom vertices 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. Then the graph has the following edges: a-1, a-3, b-1, b-2, c-1, c-2, c-4, d-5, e-4, and e-5. Of these, the edges a-1, b-2, c-4, and e-5 are highlighted bold    alternating path augmenting path path alternating path augmenting  One way you might check to see whether a partial matching is maximal is to construct an alternating path . This is a sequence of adjacent edges, which alternate between edges in the matching and edges not in the matching (no edge can be used more than once). If an alternating path starts and stops with an edge not in the matching, then it is called an augmenting path .   Find the largest possible alternating path for the partial matching of your friend's graph. Is it an augmenting path? How would this help you find a larger matching?    A bipartite graph with ten vertices in two sets of five. Call the top vertices a, b, c, d, e and the bottom vertices 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. Then the graph has the following edges: a-1, a-3, b-1, b-2, c-1, c-2, c-4, d-5, e-4, and e-5. Of these, the edges a-1, b-2, c-4, and e-5 are highlighted bold.     Find the largest possible alternating path for the partial matching below. Are there any augmenting paths? Is the partial matching the largest one that exists in the graph?    A bipartite graph with 12 vertices in two sets of six. Call the top vertices a to f and the bottom vertices 1 to 6. Then the graph has the following edges: a-2, a-3, b-1, b-3, c-1, c-2, c-4, c-5, d-3, d-5, e-3, e-4, e-5, e-6, f-5 and f-6. Of these, the edges a-3, b-1, c-2, e-4, and f-5 are highlighted bold.        The two richest families in Westeros have decided to enter into an alliance by marriage. The first family has 10 sons, the second has 10 girls. The ages of the kids in the two families match up. To avoid impropriety, the families insist that each child must marry someone either their own age, or someone one position younger or older. In fact, the graph representing agreeable marriages looks like this:    A bipartite graph with 20 vertices in two sets of ten. Each vertex in the top row is adjacent to the vertices directly below it and those vertices below and one position left or right of it.   The question: how many different acceptable marriage arrangements which marry off all 20 children are possible?   How many marriage arrangements are possible if we insist that there are exactly 6 boys who marry girls not their own age?    Could you generalize the previous answer to arrive at the total number of marriage arrangements?    How do you know you are correct? Try counting in a different way. Look at smaller family sizes and get a sequence.    Can you give a recurrence relation that fits the problem?      vertex cover cover (vertex)  We say that a set of vertices is a vertex cover if every edge of the graph is incident to a vertex in the cover (so a vertex cover covers the edges ). Since itself is a vertex cover, every graph has a vertex cover. The interesting question is about finding a minimal vertex cover, one that uses the fewest possible number of vertices.  Suppose you had a matching of a graph. How can you use that to get a minimal vertex cover? Will your method always work?  Suppose you had a minimal vertex cover for a graph. How can you use that to get a partial matching? Will your method always work?  What is the relationship between the size of the minimal vertex cover and the size of the maximal partial matching in a graph?      For many applications of matchings, it makes sense to use bipartite graphs. You might wonder, however, whether there is a way to find matchings in graphs in general.  For which does the complete graph have a matching?  Prove that if a graph has a matching, then is even.  Is the converse true? That is, do all graphs with even have a matching?  What if we also require the matching condition? Prove or disprove: If a graph with an even number of vertices satisfies for all , then the graph has a matching.      "

  "body": " Chapter Summary  Hopefully this chapter has given you some sense for the wide variety of graph theory topics as well as why these studies are interesting. There are many more interesting areas to consider and the list is increasing all the time; graph theory is an active area of mathematical research.  One reason graph theory is such a rich area of study is that it deals with such a fundamental concept: any pair of objects can either be related or not related. What the objects are and what related means varies on context, and this leads to many applications of graph theory to science and other areas of math. The objects can be countries, and two countries can be related if they share a border. The objects could be land masses which are related if there is a bridge between them. The objects could be websites which are related if there is a link from one to the other. Or we can be completely abstract: the objects are vertices which are related if their is an edge between them.  What question we ask about the graph depends on the application, but often leads to deeper, general and abstract questions worth studying in their own right. Here is a short summary of the types of questions we have considered:   Can the graph be drawn in the plane without edges crossing? If so, how many regions does this drawing divide the plane into?    Is it possible to color the vertices of the graph so that related vertices have different colors using a small number of colors? How many colors are needed?    Is it possible to trace over every edge of a graph exactly once without lifting up your pencil? What other sorts of paths might a graph posses?    Can you find subgraphs with certain properties? For example, when does a (bipartite) graph contain a subgraph in which all vertices are only related to one other vertex?     Not surprisingly, these questions are often related to each other. For example, the chromatic number of a graph cannot be greater than 4 when the graph is planar. Whether the graph has an Euler path depends on how many vertices each vertex is adjacent to (and whether those numbers are always even or not). Even the existence of matchings in bipartite graphs can be proved using paths.   Chapter Review   Which (if any) of the graphs below are the same? Which are different? Explain.     A graph with five vertices; two in a top row, and three in a bottom row. The top-left vertex is adjacent to the top-right vertex, the bottom-right vertex, and the bottom-middle vertex. The top-right vertex is also adjacent to the bottom-middle vertex and the bottom-left vertex. The bottom-middle vertex is adjacent to each of the other bottom vertices.     A graph with five vertices: a row of three, and above the middle vertex of this row, two more vertically aligned. The outer vertices in the row are adjacent to each of the vertices in the middle column. The top and middle vertices in the column are also adjacent.     A graph with five vertices: three are arranged in a top row, and the remaining two are directly below the left and right vertices on the top row. The vertex in the center of the row is adjacent to each of the other vertices. The two vertices on the left are adjacent, as are the two vertices on the right. Finally the top-left and top-right are adjacent by a curved edge.     The first and the third graphs are the same (try dragging vertices around to make the pictures match up), but the middle graph is different (which you can see, for example, by noting that the middle graph has only one vertex of degree 2, while the others have two such vertices).    Which of the graphs in the previous question contain Euler paths or circuits? Which of the graphs are planar?   The first (and third) graphs contain an Euler path. All the graphs are planar.    Draw a graph which has an Euler circuit but is not planar.   For example, .    Draw a graph which does not have an Euler path and is also not planar.   For example, .    Consider the graph with and (here we are using the shorthand for edges: really means , for example).   Is the graph isomorphic to with and ? If so, give the isomoprhism. If not, explain how you know.    Find a graph with 7 vertices and 6 edges which is NOT isomorphic to , or explain why this is not possible.    Write down the degree sequence for . That is, write down the degrees of all the vertices, in decreasing order.    Find a connected graph with the same degree sequence of which is NOT isomorphic to , or explain why this is not possible.    What kind of graph is ? Is complete? Bipartite? A tree? A cycle? A path? A wheel?    Is planar?    What is the chromatic number of ? Explain.    Does have an Euler path or circuit? Explain.         Yes, the graphs are isomorphic, which you can see by drawing them. One isomorphism is: .    This is easy to do if you draw the picture. Here is such a graph:    A tree with a bottom vertex adjacent to each of three vertices in a row above it. Each of these is adjacent to another vertex directly above them.   Any labeling of this graph will be not isomorphic to . For example, we could take and .    The degree sequence for is .    In general this should be possible: the degree sequence does not determine the graph's isomorphism class. However, in this case, I was almost certain this was not possible. That is, until I stumbled up this:    A tree with a center bottom vertex adjacent to two vertices above it. Each of these are adjacent to two vertices above them.      is a tree (there are no cycles) and as such also bipartite.    Yes, all trees are planar. You can draw them in the plane without edges crossing.    The chromatic number of is 2. It shouldn't be hard to give a 2-coloring (for example, color red and blue), but we know that all bipartite graphs have chromatic number 2.    It is clear from the drawing that there is no Euler path, let alone an Euler circuit. Also, since there are more than 2 vertices of odd degree, we know for sure there is no Euler path.       If a graph has 10 vertices and 10 edges and contains an Euler circuit, must it be planar? How many faces would it have?   Yes. According to Euler's formula it would have 2 faces. It does. The only such graph is .    Suppose is a graph with vertices, each having degree 5.   For which values of does this make sense?    For which values of does the graph have an Euler path?    What is the smallest value of for which the graph might be planar? (tricky)         Only if and is even.    None.    12. Such a graph would have edges. If the graph is planar, then so there would be faces. Also, we must have , since the graph is simple. So we must have . Solving for gives .       At a school dance, 6 girls and 4 boys take turns dancing (as couples) with each other.   How many couples danced if every girl dances with every boy?    How many couples danced if everyone danced with everyone else (regardless of gender)?    Explain what graphs can be used to represent these situations.         There were 24 couples: 6 choices for the girl and 4 choices for the boy.    There were 45 couples: since we must choose two of the 10 people to dance together.    For part (a), we are counting the number of edges in . In part (b) we count the edges of .       Among a group of people, is it possible for everyone to be friends with an odd number of people in the group? If so, what can you say about ?   Yes, as long as is even. If were odd, then corresponding graph would have an odd number of odd degree vertices, which is impossible.    Your friend has challenged you to create a convex polyhedron containing 9 triangles and 6 pentagons.   Is it possible to build such a polyhedron using only these shapes? Explain.    You decide to also include one heptagon (seven-sided polygon). How many vertices does your new convex polyhedron contain?    Assuming you are successful in building your new 16-faced polyhedron, could every vertex be the joining of the same number of faces? Could each vertex join either 3 or 4 faces? If so, how many of each type of vertex would there be?         No. The 9 triangles each contribute 3 edges, and the 6 pentagons contribute 5 edges. This gives a total of 57, which is exactly twice the number of edges, since each edge borders exactly 2 faces. But 57 is odd, so this is impossible.    Now adding up all the edges of all the 16 polygons gives a total of 64, meaning there would be 32 edges in the polyhedron. We can then use Euler's formula to deduce that there must be 18 vertices.    If you add up all the vertices from each polygon separately, we get a total of 64. This is not divisible by 3, so it cannot be that each vertex belongs to exactly 3 faces. Could they all belong to 4 faces? That would mean there were vertices, but we know from Euler's formula that there must be 18 vertices. We can write and solve for and (as integers). We get that there must be 10 vertices with degree 4 and 8 with degree 3. (Note the number of faces joined at a vertex is equal to its degree in graph theoretic terms.)       Is there a convex polyhedron which requires 5 colors to properly color the vertices of the polyhedron? Explain.   No. Every polyhedron can be represented as a planar graph, and the Four Color Theorem says that every planar graph has chromatic number at most 4.    How many edges does the graph have? For which values of does the graph contain an Euler circuit? For which values of is the graph planar?    has edges. The graph will have an Euler circuit when is even. The graph will be planar only when .    The graph has 6 vertices with degrees . How many edges does have? If was planar how many faces would it have? Does have an Euler path?    has 8 edges (since the sum of the degrees is 16). If is planar, then it will have 4 faces (since ). does not have an Euler path since there are more than 2 vertices of odd degree.    What is the smallest number of colors you need to properly color the vertices of . Can you say whether is planar based on your answer?    colors. Thus is not planar (by the contrapositive of the Four Color Theorem).    What is the smallest number of colors you need to properly color the vertices of ? Can you say whether is planar based on your answer?   The chromatic number of is 2, since the graph is bipartite. You cannot say whether the graph is planar based on this coloring (the converse of the Four Color Theorem is not true). In fact, the graph is not planar, since it contains as a subgraph.    Prove that is not planar. Do this using Euler's formula, not just by appealing to the fact that is not planar.   We have that has 7 vertices and 12 edges (each vertex in the group of 3 has degree 4). Then by Euler's formula we have that so if the graph were planar, it would have faces. However, since the girth of the graph is 4 (there are no cycles of length 3) we get that . But this would mean that , a contradiction.    A dodecahedron is a regular convex polyhedron made up of 12 regular pentagons.   Suppose you color each pentagon with one of three colors. Prove that there must be two adjacent pentagons colored identically.    What if you use four colors?    What if instead of a dodecahedron you colored the faces of a cube?      For all these questions, we are really coloring the vertices of a graph. You get the graph by first drawing a planar representation of the polyhedron and then taking its planar dual: put a vertex in the center of each face (including the outside) and connect two vertices if their faces share an edge.   Since the planar dual of a dodecahedron contains a 5-wheel, it's chromatic number is at least 4. Alternatively, suppose you could color the faces using 3 colors without any two adjacent faces colored the same. Take any face and color it blue. The 5 pentagons bordering this blue pentagon cannot be colored blue. Color the first one red. Its two neighbors (adjacent to the blue pentagon) get colored green. The remaining 2 cannot be blue or green, but also cannot both be red since they are adjacent to each other. Thus a 4th color is needed.    The planar dual of the dodecahedron is itself a planar graph. Thus by the 4-color theorem, it can be colored using only 4 colors without two adjacent vertices (corresponding to the faces of the polyhedron) being colored identically.    The cube can be properly 3-colored. Color the top and bottom red, the front and back blue, and the left and right green.       Decide whether the following statements are true or false. Prove your answers.   If two graph and have the same chromatic number, then they are isomorphic.    If two graphs and have the same number of vertices and edges and have the same chromatic number, then they are isomorphic.    If two graphs are isomorphic, then they have the same chromatic number.         False. To prove this, we can give an example of a pair of graphs with the same chromatic number that are not isomorphic. For example, and both have chromatic number 2, but are not isomorphic.    False. The previous example does not work, but you can easily draw two trees that have the same number of vertices and edges but are not isomorphic. Since all trees have chromatic number 2, this is a counterexample.    True. If there is an isomorphism from to , then we have a bijection that tells us how to match up vertices between the graph. Any proper vertex coloring of will tell us how to properly color , simply by coloring the same color as , for each vertex . That is, color the vertices in exactly how you color the corresponding vertices in . Similarly, any proper vertex coloring of corresponds to a proper vertex coloring of . Thus the smallest number of colors needed to properly color cannot be smaller than the smallest number of colors needed to properly color , and vice-versa, so the chromatic numbers must be equal.       If a planar graph with vertices divides the plane into 8 regions, how many edges must have?    has edges, since we need .    Consider the graph below:    A graph with six vertices. Two vertices are aligned in a center column, and are adjacent to each other. Each is also adjacent to each of the other four vertices.      Does the graph have an Euler path or circuit? Explain.    Is the graph planar? Explain.    Is the graph bipartite? Complete? Complete bipartite?    What is the chromatic number of the graph.         The graph does have an Euler path, but not an Euler circuit. There are exactly two vertices with odd degree. The path starts at one and ends at the other.    The graph is planar. Even though as it is drawn edges cross, it is easy to redraw it without edges crossing.    The graph is not bipartite (there is an odd cycle), nor complete.    The chromatic number of the graph is 3.       For each part below, say whether the statement is true or false. Explain why the true statements are true, and give counterexamples for the false statements.   Every bipartite graph is planar.    Every bipartite graph has chromatic number 2.    Every bipartite graph has an Euler path.    Every vertex of a bipartite graph has even degree.    A graph is bipartite if and only if the sum of the degrees of all the vertices is even.         False. For example, is not planar.    True. The graph is bipartite so it is possible to divide the vertices into two groups with no edges between vertices in the same group. Thus we can color all the vertices of one group red and the other group blue.    False. has 6 vertices with degree 3, so contains no Euler path.    False. again.    False. The sum of the degrees of all vertices is even for all graphs so this property does not imply that the graph is bipartite.       Consider the statement If a graph is planar, then it has an Euler path.    Write the converse of the statement.    Write the contrapositive of the statement.    Write the negation of the statement.    Is it possible for the contrapositive to be false? If it was, what would that tell you?    Is the original statement true or false? Prove your answer.    Is the converse of the statement true or false? Prove your answer.         If a graph has an Euler path, then it is planar.    If a graph does not have an Euler path, then it is not planar.    There is a graph which is planar and does not have an Euler path.    Yes. In fact, in this case it is because the original statement is false.    False. is planar but does not have an Euler path.    False. has an Euler path but is not planar.       Let be a connected graph with vertices and edges. Use mathematical induction to prove that if contains exactly one cycle (among other edges and vertices), then .  Note: this is asking you to prove a special case of Euler's formula for planar graphs, so do not use that formula in your proof.   You might want to give the proof in two parts. First prove by induction that the cycle has . Then consider what happens if the graph is more than just the cycle.     "

  "body": " A dodecahedron is a regular convex polyhedron made up of 12 regular pentagons.   Suppose you color each pentagon with one of three colors. Prove that there must be two adjacent pentagons colored identically.    What if you use four colors?    What if instead of a dodecahedron you colored the faces of a cube?      For all these questions, we are really coloring the vertices of a graph. You get the graph by first drawing a planar representation of the polyhedron and then taking its planar dual: put a vertex in the center of each face (including the outside) and connect two vertices if their faces share an edge.   Since the planar dual of a dodecahedron contains a 5-wheel, it's chromatic number is at least 4. Alternatively, suppose you could color the faces using 3 colors without any two adjacent faces colored the same. Take any face and color it blue. The 5 pentagons bordering this blue pentagon cannot be colored blue. Color the first one red. Its two neighbors (adjacent to the blue pentagon) get colored green. The remaining 2 cannot be blue or green, but also cannot both be red since they are adjacent to each other. Thus a 4th color is needed.    The planar dual of the dodecahedron is itself a planar graph. Thus by the 4-color theorem, it can be colored using only 4 colors without two adjacent vertices (corresponding to the faces of the polyhedron) being colored identically.    The cube can be properly 3-colored. Color the top and bottom red, the front and back blue, and the left and right green.     "

  "body": " Additive and Multiplicative Principles  additive principle  multiplicative principle  sum principle additive principle  product principle multiplicative principle       A restaurant offers 8 appetizers and 14 entrées. How many choices do you have if:  you will eat one dish, either an appetizer or an entrée?  you are extra hungry and want to eat both an appetizer and an entrée?      Think about the methods you used to solve question 1. Write down the rules for these methods.    Do your rules work? A standard deck of playing cards has 26 red cards and 12 face cards.  How many ways can you select a card which is either red or a face card?  How many ways can you select a card which is both red and a face card?  How many ways can you select two cards so that the first one is red and the second one is a face card?        Consider this rather simple counting problem: at Red Dogs and Donuts, there are 14 varieties of donuts, and 16 types of hot dogs. If you want either a donut or a dog, how many options do you have? This isn't too hard, just add 14 and 16. Will that always work? What is important here?   Additive Principle  additive principle  The additive principle states that if event can occur in ways, and event can occur in  disjoint ways, then the event or can occur in ways.    disjoint events It is important that the events be disjoint : i.e., that there is no way for and to both happen at the same time. For example, a standard deck of 52 cards contains red cards and face cards. However, the number of ways to select a card which is either red or a face card is not . This is because there are 6 cards which are both red and face cards.     word (counting) How many two letter words start with either A or B? (A word is just a string of letters; it doesn't have to be English, or even pronounceable.)    First, how many two letter words start with A? We just need to select the second letter, which can be accomplished in 26 ways. So there are 26 words starting with A. There are also 26 words that start with B. To select a word which starts with either A or B, we can pick the word from the first 26 or the second 26, for a total of 52 words.    The additive principle also works with more than two events. Say, in addition to your 14 choices for donuts and 16 for dogs, you would also consider eating one of 15 waffles? How many choices do you have now? You would have options.    How many two letter words start with one of the 5 vowels?    There are 26 two letter words starting with A, another 26 starting with E, and so on. We will have 5 groups of 26. So we add 26 to itself 5 times. Of course it would be easier to just multiply . We are really using the additive principle again, just using multiplication as a shortcut.      Suppose you are going for some fro-yo. You can pick one of 6 yogurt choices, and one of 4 toppings. How many choices do you have?    Break your choices up into disjoint events: are the choices with the first topping, the choices featuring the second topping, and so on. There are four events; each can occur in 6 ways (one for each yogurt flavor). The events are disjoint, so the total number of choices is .    Note that in both of the previous examples, when using the additive principle on a bunch of events all the same size, it is quicker to multiply. This really is the same, and not just because . We can first select the topping in 4 ways (that is, we first select which of the disjoint events we will take). For each of those first 4 choices, we now have 6 choices of yogurt. We have:   Multiplicative Principle  multiplicative principle  The multiplicative principle states that if event can occur in ways, and each possibility for allows for exactly ways for event , then the event and can occur in ways.   The multiplicative principle generalizes to more than two events as well.    How many license plates can you make out of three letters followed by three numerical digits?    Here we have six events: the first letter, the second letter, the third letter, the first digit, the second digit, and the third digit. The first three events can each happen in 26 ways; the last three can each happen in 10 ways. So the total number of license plates will be , using the multiplicative principle.  Does this make sense? Think about how we would pick a license plate. How many choices we would have? First, we need to pick the first letter. There are 26 choices. Now for each of those, there are 26 choices for the second letter: 26 second letters with first letter A, 26 second letters with first letter B, and so on. We add 26 to itself 26 times. Or quicker: there are choices for the first two letters.  Now for each choice of the first two letters, we have 26 choices for the third letter. That is, 26 third letters for the first two letters AA, 26 choices for the third letter after starting AB, and so on. There are of these third letter choices, for a total of choices for the first three letters. And for each of these choices of letters, we have a bunch of choices for the remaining digits.  In fact, there are going to be exactly 1000 choices for the numbers. We can see this because there are 1000 three-digit numbers (000 through 999). This is 10 choices for the first digit, 10 for the second, and 10 for the third. The multiplicative principle says we multiply: .  All together, there were choices for the three letters, and choices for the numbers, so we have a total of choices of license plates.    Careful: and doesn't mean times. For example, how many playing cards are both red and a face card? Not . The answer is 6, and we needed to know something about cards to answer that question.  Another caution: how many ways can you select two cards, so that the first one is a red card and the second one is a face card? This looks more like the multiplicative principle (you are counting two separate events) but the answer is not here either. The problem is that while there are 26 ways for the first card to be selected, it is not the case that for each of those there are 12 ways to select the second card. If the first card was both red and a face card, then there would be only 11 choices for the second card. To solve this problem, you could break it into two cases. First, count how many ways there are to select the two cards when the first card is a red non-face card. Second, count how many ways when the first card is a red face card. Doing so makes the events in each separate case independent, so the multiplicative principle can be applied.   Counting functions  function counting  counting functions   How many functions are there?    Remember that a function sends each element of the domain to exactly one element of the codomain. To determine a function, we just need to specify the image of each element in the domain. Where can we send 1? There are 4 choices. Where can we send 2? Again, 4 choices. What we have here is 5 events (picking the image of an element in the domain) each of which can happen in 4 ways (the choices for that image). Thus there are functions.  This is more than just an example of how we can use the multiplicative principle in a particular counting question. What we have here is a general interpretation of certain applications of the multiplicative principle using rigorously defined mathematical objects: functions. Whenever we have a counting question that asks for the number of outcomes of a repeated event, we can interpret that as asking for the number of functions from (where is the number of times the event is repeated) to (where is the number of ways that event can occur).      Counting With Sets  Do you believe the additive and multiplicative principles? How would you convince someone they are correct? This is surprisingly difficult. They seem so simple, so obvious. But why do they work?  To make things clearer, and more mathematically rigorous, we will use sets. Do not skip this section! It might seem like we are just trying to give a proof of these principles, but we are doing a lot more. If we understand the additive and multiplicative principles rigorously, we will be better at applying them, and knowing when and when not to apply them at all.  We will look at the additive and multiplicative principles in a slightly different way. Instead of thinking about event and event , we want to think of a set and a set . The sets will contain all the different ways the event can happen. (It will be helpful to be able to switch back and forth between these two models when checking that we have counted correctly.) Here's what we mean:    Suppose you own 9 shirts and 5 pairs of pants.   How many outfits can you make?    If today is half-naked-day, and you will wear only a shirt or only a pair of pants, how many choices do you have?       By now you should agree that the answer to the first question is and the answer to the second question is . These are the multiplicative and additive principles. There are two events: picking a shirt and picking a pair of pants. The first event can happen in 9 ways and the second event can happen in 5 ways. To get both a shirt and a pair of pants, you multiply. To get just one article of clothing, you add.  Now look at this using sets. There are two sets, call them and . The set contains all 9 shirts so while , since there are 5 elements in the set (namely your 5 pairs of pants). What are we asking in terms of these sets? Well in question 2, we really want , the number of elements in the union of shirts and pants. This is just (since there is no overlap; ). Question 1 is slightly more complicated. Your first guess might be to find , but this is not right (there is nothing in the intersection). We are not asking for how many clothing items are both a shirt and a pair of pants. Instead, we want one of each. We could think of this as asking how many pairs there are, where is a shirt and is a pair of pants. As we will soon verify, this number is .    From this example we can see right away how to rephrase our additive principle in terms of sets:   Additive Principle (with sets)  additive principle using sets  cardinality of a union  union of sets cardinality of  Given two sets and , if (that is, if there is no element in common to both and ), then .   This hardly needs a proof. To find , you take everything in and throw in everything in . Since there is no element in both sets already, you will have things and add new things to it. This is what adding does! Of course, we can easily extend this to any number of disjoint sets.  From the example above, we see that in order to investigate the multiplicative principle carefully, we need to consider ordered pairs. We should define this carefully:   Cartesian Product  Cartesian product  Given sets and , we can form the set  to be the set of all ordered pairs where is an element of and is an element of . We call the Cartesian product of and .     Let and . Find .    We want to find ordered pairs where can be either or and can be either 3, 4, or 5. is the set of all of these pairs: .    The question is, what is ? To figure this out, write out . Let and (so and ). The set contains all pairs with the first half of the pair being some and the second being one of the . In other words: .  Notice what we have done here: we made rows of pairs, for a total of pairs.  Each row above is really for some . That is, we fixed the -element. Broken up this way, we have .  So is really the union of disjoint sets. Each of those sets has elements in them. The total (using the additive principle) is .  To summarize:   Multiplicative Principle (with sets)  multiplicative principle using sets  cardinality of Cartesian product  Cartesian product cardinality of  Given two sets and , we have .   Again, we can easily extend this to any number of sets.    Principle of Inclusion\/Exclusion  principle of inclusion\/exclusion  PIE principle of inclusion\/exclusion  inclusion\/exclusion principle of inclusion\/exclusion   A recent buzz marketing campaign for Village Inn surveyed patrons on their pie preferences.

Venn diagram for counting While we are thinking about sets, consider what happens to the additive principle when the sets are NOT disjoint. Suppose we want to find and know that and . This is not enough information though. We do not know how many of the 8 elements in are also elements of . However, if we also know that , then we can say exactly how many elements are in , and, of those, how many are in and how many are not (6 of the 10 elements are in , so 4 are in but not in ). We could fill in a Venn diagram as follows:     Intersecting circles labeled A and B. Inside the region enclosed by both circles is the number 6. The number 4 is in the region inside A but outside B. The number 2 is in the region inside B but outside A.    This says there are 6 elements in , 4 elements in and 2 elements in . Now these three sets are disjoint, so we can use the additive principle to find the number of elements in . It is .  This will always work, but drawing a Venn diagram is more than we need to do. In fact, it would be nice to relate this problem to the case where and are disjoint. Is there one rule we can make that works in either case?  Here is another way to get the answer to the problem above. Start by just adding . This is , which would be the answer if . We see that we are off by exactly 6, which just so happens to be . So perhaps we guess, .  This works for this one example. Will it always work? Think about what we are doing here. We want to know how many things are either in or (or both). We can throw in everything in , and everything in . This would give many elements. But of course when you actually take the union, you do not repeat elements that are in both. So far we have counted every element in exactly twice: once when we put in the elements from and once when we included the elements from . We correct by subtracting out the number of elements we have counted twice. So we added them in twice, subtracted once, leaving them counted only one time.  In other words, we have:   Cardinality of a union (2 sets)  principle of inclusion\/exclusion for 2 sets  cardinality of a union  For any finite sets and , .   We can do something similar with three sets.    An examination in three subjects, Algebra, Biology, and Chemistry, was taken by 41 students. The following table shows how many students failed in each single subject and in their various combinations:     Subject:  A  B  C  AB  AC  BC  ABC    Failed:  12  5  8  2  6  3  1     How many students failed at least one subject?    The answer is not 37, even though the sum of the numbers above is 37. For example, while 12 students failed Algebra, 2 of those students also failed Biology, 6 also failed Chemistry, and 1 of those failed all three subjects. In fact, that 1 student who failed all three subjects is counted a total of 7 times in the total 37. To clarify things, let us think of the students who failed Algebra as the elements of the set , and similarly for sets and . The one student who failed all three subjects is the lone element of the set . Thus, in Venn diagrams:     Three intersecting circles labeled A, B, and C. The center region inside all three circles contains the number 1.    Now let's fill in the other intersections. We know contains 2 elements, but 1 element has already been counted. So we should put a 1 in the region where and intersect (but does not). Similarly, we calculate the cardinality of , and :     Three intersecting circles labeled A, B, and C. The center region inside all three circles contains the number 1. The region above this, inside both A and B but outside C, contains the number 1. The region inside both A and C but outside B contains the number 5. The region inside B and C but outside A contains the number 2.    Next, we determine the numbers which should go in the remaining regions, including outside of all three circles. This last number is the number of students who did not fail any subject:     Three intersecting circles labeled A, B, and C. The center region inside all three circles contains the number 1. The region above this, inside both A and B but outside C, contains the number 1. The region inside both A and C but outside B contains the number 5. The region inside B and C but outside A contains the number 2. The region just inside A contains the number 5; the region just inside B contains the number 1; the region just inside C contains the number 0. The number 26 is outside all three circles.    We found 5 goes in the only region because the entire circle for needed to have a total of 12, and 7 were already accounted for. Similarly, we calculate the only region to contain only 1 student and the only region to contain no students.  Thus the number of students who failed at least one class is 15 (the sum of the numbers in each of the eight disjoint regions). The number of students who passed all three classes is 26: the total number of students, 41, less the 15 who failed at least one class.  Note that we can also answer other questions. For example, how many students failed just Chemistry? None. How many passed Algebra but failed both Biology and Chemistry? This corresponds to the region inside both and but outside of , containing 2 students.    Could we have solved the problem above in an algebraic way? While the additive principle generalizes to any number of sets, when we add a third set here, we must be careful. With two sets, we needed to know the cardinalities of , , and in order to find the cardinality of . With three sets we need more information. There are more ways the sets can combine. Not surprisingly then, the formula for cardinality of the union of three non-disjoint sets is more complicated:   Cardinality of a union (3 sets)   principle of inclusion\/exclusion  for 3 sets    cardinality  of a union   For any finite sets , , and , .   To determine how many elements are in at least one of , , or we add up all the elements in each of those sets. However, when we do that, any element in both and is counted twice. Also, each element in both and is counted twice, as are elements in and , so we take each of those out of our sum once. But now what about the elements which are in (in all three sets)? We added them in three times, but also removed them three times. They have not yet been counted. Thus we add those elements back in at the end.  Returning to our example above, we have , , . We also have , , , and . Therefore: .  This is what we got when we solved the problem using Venn diagrams.  This process of adding in, then taking out, then adding back in, and so on is called the Principle of Inclusion\/Exclusion , or simply PIE. We will return to this counting technique later to solve for more complicated problems (involving more than 3 sets).     How will you decide if you should add or multiply when combining numbers in a counting problem? Explain how you are currently thinking about this.    Your cousin is trying to solve a counting problem about how many different routes he can take between his dorm and his classroom. He has 9 routes that make sense, and similarly, there are 9 routes to go back from his classroom to his dorm.  How many round trips are possible? Your cousin says 18, because after going from his dorm to the classroom, he has to add on a route back to the dorm. Is he right? Why or why not?     Practice Problems    Your wardrobe consists of 2 shirts, 6 pairs of pants, and 18 bow ties. How many different outfits can you make?  You can make outfits.        There are outfits. Use the multiplicative principle.         For your college interview, you must wear a tie. You own 6 regular (boring) ties and 2 (cool) bow ties.   How many choices do you have for your neck-wear?    You realize that the interview is for clown college, so you should probably wear both a regular tie and a bow tie. How many choices do you have now?    For the rest of your outfit, you have 6 shirts, 3 skirts, 7 pants, and 4 dresses. You want to select either a shirt to wear with a skirt or pants, or just a dress. How many outfits do you have to choose from?                      ties. Use the additive principle.    ties. Use the multiplicative principle    outfits.           We usually write numbers in decimal form (or base 10), meaning numbers are composed using 10 different digits  Sometimes though it is useful to write numbers hexadecimal or base 16. Now there are 16 distinct digits that can be used to form numbers: So for example, a 3 digit hexadecimal number might be 2B8.    How many 4-digit hexadecimals are there in which the first digit is E or F?    How many 5-digit hexadecimals start with a letter (A-F) and end with a numeral (0-9)?    How many 3-digit hexadecimals start with a letter (A-F) or end with a numeral (0-9) (or both)?                      There are 4096 4-digit hexadecimals in which the first digit is an E (one for each choice of the remaining digits). Similarly, there are 4096 hexadecimals in which the first digit is an F. We want the union of these two disjoint sets, so there are 4-digits hexadecimals in which the first digit is either an E or an F.    We can select the first digit in 6 ways, digits 2-4 in 16 ways each, and the final digit in 10 ways. Thus there are hexadecimals given these restrictions.    The number of 3-digit hexadecimals that start with a letter is The number of 3-hexadecimals that end with a numeral is We want all the elements from both these sets. However, both sets include those 3-digit hexadecimals which both start with a letter and end with a numeral( ) so we must subtract these (once).

Of those surveyed, 27 students watch The Walking Dead , 21 watch The Blacklist , and 24 watch Game of Thrones . Additionally, 12 watch The Walking Dead and The Blacklist , 13 watch The Walking Dead and Game of Thrones , and 17 watch The Blacklist and Game of Thrones . There are 9 students who watch all three shows. How many students surveyed watched at least one of the shows?        39 students. Use Venn diagram or PIE:         In a recent survey, 80 students reported whether they liked their potatoes Mashed, French-fried, or Twice-baked. 42 liked them mashed, 46 liked French fried, and 43 liked twice baked potatoes. Additionally, 35 students liked both mashed and fried potatoes, 22 liked French fries and twice baked potatoes, 20 liked mashed and baked, and 16 liked all three styles. How many students hate potatoes? Explain why your answer is correct.        Using the principle of inclusion\/exclusion, the number of students who like their potatoes in at least one of the ways described is     Therefore there are students who do not like potatoes. You can also do this problem with a Venn diagram.         For how many is a multiple of one or more of 9, 2, or 7?   To find out how many numbers are divisible by 9 and 7, for example, take and round down.        467 values of Use PIE: or a Venn diagram. To find out how many numbers are divisible by 2 and 7, for example, take and round down.         How many positive integers less than 1500 are multiples of 2, 7, or 3? Use the Principle of Inclusion\/Exclusion.        To find out how many numbers strictly less than 1500 are multiples of 2, we can divide 1500 by 2 and round down. There are 749 many of these. Similarly, there are 214 multiples of 7 and 499 multiples of 3 less than 1500.  We also need the combinations of these. To be a multiple of 2 and 7 means you are a multiple of 14 , and there are 107 multiples of 2 and 7. There will be 249 multiples of 2 and 3. There will be 71 multiples of 7 and 3. Finally, there will be 35 multiples of all three.  Using PIE, we get     multiples of 2, 7, or 3 less than 1500.         We want to build 12 letter words using only the first letters of the alphabet. For example, if we can use the first 5 letters, (Recall, words are just strings of letters, not necessarily actual English words.)   How many of these words are there total?    How many of these words contain no repeated letters?    How many of these words start with the sub-word ade ?    How many of these words either start with ade or end with be or both?    How many of the words containing no repeats also do not contain the sub-word bed ?                                words, since you select from 6 letters 12 times.    ( words. After selecting a letter, you have fewer letters to select for the next one.    words: you need to select the letters that follow the ade.    words.

The answer is not 37, even though the sum of the numbers above is 37. For example, while 12 students failed Algebra, 2 of those students also failed Biology, 6 also failed Chemistry, and 1 of those failed all three subjects. In fact, that 1 student who failed all three subjects is counted a total of 7 times in the total 37. To clarify things, let us think of the students who failed Algebra as the elements of the set , and similarly for sets and . The one student who failed all three subjects is the lone element of the set . Thus, in Venn diagrams:     Three intersecting circles labeled A, B, and C. The center region inside all three circles contains the number 1.    Now let's fill in the other intersections. We know contains 2 elements, but 1 element has already been counted. So we should put a 1 in the region where and intersect (but does not). Similarly, we calculate the cardinality of , and :     Three intersecting circles labeled A, B, and C. The center region inside all three circles contains the number 1. The region above this, inside both A and B but outside C, contains the number 1. The region inside both A and C but outside B contains the number 5. The region inside B and C but outside A contains the number 2.    Next, we determine the numbers which should go in the remaining regions, including outside of all three circles. This last number is the number of students who did not fail any subject:     Three intersecting circles labeled A, B, and C. The center region inside all three circles contains the number 1. The region above this, inside both A and B but outside C, contains the number 1. The region inside both A and C but outside B contains the number 5. The region inside B and C but outside A contains the number 2. The region just inside A contains the number 5; the region just inside B contains the number 1; the region just inside C contains the number 0. The number 26 is outside all three circles.    We found 5 goes in the only region because the entire circle for needed to have a total of 12, and 7 were already accounted for. Similarly, we calculate the only region to contain only 1 student and the only region to contain no students.  Thus the number of students who failed at least one class is 15 (the sum of the numbers in each of the eight disjoint regions). The number of students who passed all three classes is 26: the total number of students, 41, less the 15 who failed at least one class.  Note that we can also answer other questions. For example, how many students failed just Chemistry? None. How many passed Algebra but failed both Biology and Chemistry? This corresponds to the region inside both and but outside of , containing 2 students.   "

Fill in each square of the chess board below with the number of different shortest paths the rook, in the upper left corner, can take to get to that square. For example, one square is already filled in. There are six different paths from the rook to the square: DDRR (down down right right), DRDR, DRRD, RDDR, RDRD and RRDD.     An 8x8 checkerboard containing an image of a rook chess piece in the top left corner. The square in the third row, third column contains the number 6.     Here are some apparently different discrete objects we can count: subsets, bit strings, lattice paths, and binomial coefficients. We will give an example of each type of counting problem (and say what these things even are). As we will see, these counting problems are surprisingly similar.    Subsets  subset  subset counting  Recall that a subset of a set is any set all of whose elements are also in . (More information about sets can be found in and .) Suppose we look at the set . A few of the 3-element subsets of are , , and . How many subsets of contain exactly 3 elements all together?  First, a simpler question: How many subsets of are there total? We call the set of all subsets of a set the power set of , written . So we are now asking for for the cardinality of the power set: .  Think about how we would build a subset. We need to decide, for each of the elements of , whether or not to include the element in our subset. So we need to decide yes or no for the element 1. And for each choice we make, we need to decide yes or no for the element 2. And so on. For each of the 5 elements, we have 2 choices. Therefore the number of subsets is simply (by the multiplicative principle).  Of those 32 subsets, how many have 3 elements? This is not obvious. Note that we cannot just use the multiplicative principle. Maybe we want to say we have 2 choices (yes\/no) for the first element, 2 choices for the second, 2 choices for the third, and then only 1 choice for the other two. But what if we said no to one of the first three elements? Then we would have two choices for the 4th element. What a mess!  Another idea: we need to pick three elements to be in our subset. There are 5 elements to choose from. So there are 5 choices for the first element, and for each of those 4 choices for the second, and then 3 for the third (last) element. The multiplicative principle would say then that there are a total of ways to select the 3-element subset. But this cannot be correct ( for one thing). One of the outcomes we would get from these choices would be the set , by choosing the element 3 first, then the element 2, then the element 5. Another outcome would be by choosing the element 5 first, then the element 2, then the element 3. But these are the same set! We can correct this by dividing: for each set of three elements, there are 6 outcomes counted among our 60 (since there are 3 choices for which element we list first, 2 for which we list second, and 1 for which we list last). So we expect there to be 10 3-element subsets of .  Is this right? Well, we could list out all 10 of them, being very systematic in doing so, to make sure we don't miss any or list any twice. Or we could try to count how many subsets of  don't have 3 elements in them. How many have no elements? Just 1 (the empty set). How many have 5? Again, just 1. These are the cases in which we say no to all elements, or yes to all elements. Okay, what about the subsets which contain a single element? There are 5 of these. We must say yes to exactly one element, and there are 5 to choose from. This is also the number of subsets containing 4 elements. Those are the ones for which we must say no to exactly one element.  So far we have counted 12 of the 32 subsets. We have not yet counted the subsets with cardinality 2 and with cardinality 3. There are a total of 20 subsets left to split up between these two groups. But the number of each must be the same! If we say yes to exactly two elements, that can be accomplished in exactly the same number of ways as the number of ways we can say no to exactly two elements. So the number of 2-element subsets is equal to the number of 3-element subsets. Together there are 20 of these subsets, so 10 each.     Number of elements:  0  1  2  3  4  5    Number of subsets:  1  5  10  10  5  1       Bit Strings  bit string   bit string  bit  binary digit bit  Bit is short for binary digit, so a bit string is a string of binary digits. The binary digits are simply the numbers 0 and 1. All of the following are bit strings: .   bit string length  bit string weight  length of a bit string  weight of a bit string The number of bits (0's or 1's) in the string is the length of the string; the strings above have lengths 4, 1, 4, and 10 respectively. We also can ask how many of the bits are 1's. The number of 1's in a bit string is the weight of the string; the weights of the above strings are 2, 0, 4, and 5 respectively.   Bit Strings  bit string  string binary bit string  bit string length  bit string weight  length of a bit string  weight of a bit string     An -bit string is a bit string of length . That is, it is a string containing symbols, each of which is a bit, either 0 or 1.    The weight  weight (bit string) of a bit string is the number of 1's in it.       the set of length bit strings  is the set of all -bit strings.      the set of length bit strings with weight .  is the set of all -bit strings of weight .     For example, the elements of the set are the bit strings 011, 101, and 110. Those are the only strings containing three bits exactly two of which are 1's.  The counting questions: How many bit strings have length 5? How many of those have weight 3? In other words, we are asking for the cardinalities and .  To find the number of 5-bit strings is straight forward. We have 5 bits, and each can either be a 0 or a 1. So there are 2 choices for the first bit, 2 choices for the second, and so on. By the multiplicative principle, there are such strings.  Finding the number of 5-bit strings of weight 3 is harder. Think about how such a string could start. The first bit must be either a 0 or a 1. In the first case (the string starts with a 0), we must then decide on four more bits. To have a total of three 1's, among those four remaining bits there must be three 1's. To count all of these strings, we must include all 4-bit strings of weight 3. In the second case (the string starts with a 1), we still have four bits to choose, but now only two of them can be 1's, so we should look at all the 4-bit strings of weight 2. So the strings in all have the form (that is, a 1 followed by a string from ) or . These two sets are disjoint, so we can use the additive principle: .   recurrence relation for number of bit strings This is an example of a recurrence relation . We represented one instance of our counting problem in terms of two simpler instances of the problem. If only we knew the cardinalities of and . Repeating the same reasoning, .  We can keep going down, but this should be good enough. Both and contain 3 bit strings: we must pick one of the three bits to be a 1 (three ways to do that) or one of the three bits to be a 0 (three ways to do that). Also, contains just one string: 111. Thus and , which puts at a total of 10 strings.   bit string as code for a subset  subset encoding as bit string But wait 32 and 10 were the answers to the counting questions about subsets. Coincidence? Not at all. Each bit string can be thought of as a code for a subset. To represent the subsets of , we can use 5-bit strings, one bit for each element of . Each bit in the string is a 0 if its corresponding element of is not in the subset, and a 1 if the element of is in the subset. Remember, deciding the subset amounted to a sequence of five yes\/no votes for the elements of . Instead of yes, we put a 1; instead of no, we put a 0.  For example, the bit string represents the subset since the first, second and fifth bits are 1's. The subset would be coded by the string . What we really have here is a bijection from to .  Now for a subset to contain exactly three elements, the corresponding bit string must contain exactly three 1's. In other words, the weight must be 3. Thus counting the number of 3-element subsets of is the same as counting the number 5-bit strings of weight 3.    Lattice Paths   integer lattice  lattice, integer integer lattice The integer lattice is the set of all points in the Cartesian plane for which both the and coordinates are integers. If you like to draw graphs on graph paper, the lattice is the set of all the intersections of the grid lines.  A lattice path  lattice path is one of the shortest possible paths connecting two points on the lattice, moving only horizontally and vertically. For example, here are three possible lattice paths from the point to :     A grid of 12 dots arranged in a 4-wide by 3-high rectangle. The lower-left dot is labeled (0,0). The top right dot is labeled (3,2). A bold line runs from the bottom left dot to the third dot on the bottom row, then turns up and runs to the top dot in that column, then turns right and runs to the top-right dot.     A grid of 12 dots arranged in a 4-wide by 3-high rectangle. The lower-left dot is labeled (0,0). The top right dot is labeled (3,2). A bold line runs from the bottom up to the top left dot, and then to the top-right dot.     A grid of 12 dots arranged in a 4-wide by 3-high rectangle. The lower-left dot is labeled (0,0). The top right dot is labeled (3,2). A bold line runs from the bottom left dot to the second dot on the bottom row, then turns up and runs to the next dot above it, then turns right and runs to the middle right dot, and finally turns up and runs to the top-right dot.    Notice to ensure the path is the shortest possible, each move must be either to the right or up. Additionally, in this case, note that no matter what path we take, we must make three steps right and two steps up. No matter what order we make these steps, there will always be 5 steps. Thus each path has length 5. lattice path length of   The counting question: how many lattice paths are there between and ? We could try to draw all of these, or instead of drawing them, maybe just list which direction we travel on each of the 5 steps. One path might be RRUUR, or maybe UURRR, or perhaps RURRU (those correspond to the three paths drawn above). So how many such strings of R's and U's are there?   lattice path correspondence with bit string  bit string correspondence with lattice path Notice that each of these strings must contain 5 symbols. Exactly 3 of them must be R's (since our destination is 3 units to the right). This seems awfully familiar. In fact, what if we used 's instead of R's and 0's instead of U's? Then we would just have 5-bit strings of weight 3. There are 10 of those, so there are 10 lattice paths from (0,0) to (3,2).  The correspondence between bit strings and lattice paths does not stop there. Here is another way to count lattice paths. Consider the lattice shown below:     A grid of 12 dots arranged in a 4-wide by 3-high rectangle. The lower-left dot is labeled (0,0). The top right dot is labeled (3,2). The dot on the top row directly to the left of (3,2) is labeled A; the dot directly below (3,2) is labeled B.    Any lattice path from (0,0) to (3,2) must pass through exactly one of and . The point is 4 steps away from (0,0) and two of them are towards the right. The number of lattice paths to is the same as the number of 4-bit strings of weight 2, namely 6. The point is 4 steps away from (0,0), but now 3 of them are towards the right. So the number of paths to point is the same as the number of 4-bit strings of weight 3, namely 4. So the total number of paths to (3,2) is just . This is the same way we calculated the number of 5-bit strings of weight 3. The point: the exact same recurrence relation exists for bit strings and for lattice paths. recurrence relation for number of lattice paths     Binomial Coefficients  binomial coefficient   binomial coefficient  Binomial coefficients are the coefficients in the expanded version of a binomial, such as . What happens when we multiply such a binomial out? We will expand for various values of . Each of these are done by multiplying everything out (i.e., FOIL-ing) and then collecting like terms.    .  In fact, there is a quicker way to expand the above binomials. For example, consider the next one, . What we are really doing is multiplying out, .  If that looks daunting, go back to the case of . Why do we only have one and but three and terms? Every time we distribute over an we create two copies of what is left, one multiplied by , the other multiplied by . To get , we need to pick the multiplied by side every time (we don't have any 's in the term). This will only happen once. On the other hand, to get we need to select the side twice and the side once. In other words, we need to pick one of the three terms to contribute their .  Similarly, in the expansion of , there will be only one term and one term. This is because to get an , we need to use the term in each of the copies of the binomial , and similarly for . What about ? To get terms like this, we need to use four 's and one , so we need exactly one of the five binomials to contribute a . There are 5 choices for this, so there are 5 ways to get , so the coefficient of is 5. This is also the coefficient for for the same (but opposite) reason: there are 5 ways to pick which of the 5 binomials contribute the single . So far we have .  We still need the coefficients of and . In both cases, we need to pick exactly 3 of the 5 binomials to contribute one variable, the other two to contribute the other. Wait. This sounds familiar. We have 5 things, each can be one of two things, and we need a total of 3 of one of them. That's just like taking 5 bits and making sure exactly 3 of them are 1's. So the coefficient of (and also ) will be exactly the same as the number of bit strings of length 5 and weight 3, which we found earlier to be 10. So we have: .  These numbers we keep seeing over and over again. They are the number of subsets of a particular size, the number of bit strings of a particular weight, the number of lattice paths, and the coefficients of these binomial products. We will call them binomial coefficients . We even have a special symbol for them: .   Binomial Coefficients  binomial coefficient  choose binomial coefficient  binomial coefficient objects counted by  For each integer and integer with there is a number , read choose . We have:   , the number of -bit strings of weight .   is the number of subsets of a set of size each with cardinality .   is the number of lattice paths of length containing steps to the right.   is the coefficient of in the expansion of .   is the number of ways to select objects from a total of objects.     The last bullet point is usually taken as the definition of . Out of objects we must choose of them, so there are choose ways of doing this. Each of our counting problems above can be viewed in this way:   How many subsets of contain exactly 3 elements? We must choose of the 5 elements to be in our subset. There are ways to do this, so there are such subsets.    How many bit strings have length 5 and weight 3? We must choose of the 5 bits to be 1's. There are ways to do this, so there are such bit strings.    How many lattice paths are there from (0,0) to (3,2)? We must choose 3 of the 5 steps to be towards the right. There are ways to do this, so there are such lattice paths.    What is the coefficient of in the expansion of ? We must choose 3 of the 5 copies of the binomial to contribute an . There are ways to do this, so the coefficient is .     It should be clear that in each case above, we have the right answer. All we had to do is phrase the question correctly and it became obvious that is correct. However, this does not tell us that the answer is in fact 10 in each case. We will eventually find a formula for , but for now, look back at how we arrived at the answer 10 in our counting problems above. It all came down to bit strings, and we have a recurrence relation for bit strings: .  Remember, this is because we can start the bit string with either a 1 or a 0. In both cases, we have more bits to pick. The strings starting with 1 must contain more 1's, while the strings starting with 0 still need more 1's.  Since , the same recurrence relation holds for binomial coefficients:   Recurrence relation for  recurrence relation for binomial coefficient  binomial coefficient recurrence relation for   .     Pascal's Triangle  Pascal's triangle  Let's arrange the binomial coefficients into a triangle like follows:    Triangular array of binomial coefficients. Each lower row extends equally on both sides beyond the row above. Top row contains 0 choose 0. Second row contains 1 choose 0 and 1 choose 1 (from left to right). Third row contains 2 choose 0, 2 choose 1, and 2 choose 2. Below that the row contains 3 choose 0, 3 choose 1, 3 choose 2, and 3 choose 3. The bottom row contains 4 choose 0 through 4 choose 4.   This can continue as far down as we like. The recurrence relation for tells us that each entry in the triangle is the sum of the two entries above it. The entries on the sides of the triangle are always 1. This is because for all since there is only one way to pick 0 of objects and since there is one way to select all out of objects. Using the recurrence relation, and the fact that the sides of the triangle are 1's, we can easily replace all the entries above with the correct values of . Doing so gives us Pascal's triangle . Pascal's triangle   We can use Pascal's triangle to calculate binomial coefficients. For example, using the triangle below, we can find .    The first 17 rows of Pascal's Triangle. A triangular array of hexagons, each row containing one more hexagon that the row above it. In each hexagon is an integer: 1's on the border of the triangle, and every integer inside the triangle the sum of the two integers above it.      Why is the number of lattice paths from to the same as the number of -bit strings with weight 5?    The number of subsets of of size 3 is the same as the number of subsets of of size either or . Explain why this makes sense.     Practice Problems    Let    How many subsets are there total?    How many subsets have as a subset?    How many subsets contain at least one odd number?    How many subsets contain exactly one even number?                           subsets. We need to select yes\/no for each of the 8 elements.    subsets. We need to select yes\/no for each of the remaining 5 elements.    subsets. We subtract the number of subsets which do not contain any odd numbers ( -select yes or no for each even element) from the total number of possible subsets.    subsets. First pick the even number. Then say yes or no to each of the odd numbers.           Let    How many subsets are there of cardinality 4?  (Note: you can enter C(n,k) for )    How many subsets of cardinality 4 have as a subset?    How many subsets of cardinality 4 contain at least one odd number?    How many subsets of cardinality 4 contain exactly one even number?                           subsets.    subsets. We need to select 1 of the 3 remaining elements of to be in the subset.    subsets. All subsets of cardinality 4 must contain at least one odd number.    subsets. Select 1 of the 3 even numbers. The remaining 3 odd numbers of must all be in the set.           Let    How many subsets of are there? That is, find    How many subsets of contain exactly 5 elements?    How many subsets of contain only even numbers?    How many subsets of contain an even number of elements?                           There are subsets. This is which makes sense because we are deciding yes or no on whether to include each element of in the subset.    Of the 6 elements in we must choose 5 of them to be in the subset. So    For each of the 6 elements from we must decide yes or no on whether to include them in the subset. However, for the odd numbers, we only have one choice: no. So there are only 3 elements we have two choices for, so the answer is (Note, if you wish to exclude the empty set - it does not contain odd numbers, but no evens either - then you could subtract 1).    Count the number of subsets with each possible even cardinality:               How many -bit strings (that is, bit strings of length 12) are there which:   Start with the sub-string 011?    Have weight 6 (i.e., contain exactly 6 1 s) and start with the sub-string 011?    Either start with or end with (or both)?    Have weight 6 and either start with or end with (or both)?                           You have 2 choices for each of the remaining 9 bits.    You need to choose 4 of the remaining 9 bits to be 1 s.    1408. There are strings that start with 011, and another which end with 01 (we choose 1 or 0 for 10 bits). However, we count the strings that start with 011 and end with 01 twice - there are such strings. So using PIE, we have    343. There are strings of weight 6 which start with 011, and another which end with 01. We have over counted again - there are weight 6 strings which both start with 011 and end with 01, in fact of them. So all together we have strings.           You break your piggy-bank to discover lots of pennies and nickels. You start arranging these in rows of 4 coins.   You find yourself making rows containing an equal number of pennies and nickels. For fun, you decide to lay out every possible such row. How many coins will you need?    How many coins would you need to make all possible rows of 4 coins (not necessarily with equal number of pennies and nickels)?                 We can think of each row as a 4-bit string of weight 2 (since of the 4 coins, we require 2 to be pennies). Thus there are rows possible. Each row requires 4 coins, so if we want to make all the rows at the same time, we will need 24 coins, half of them nickels and half of them pennies.    Now there are rows possible, which is also if you break them up into rows containing 0, 1, 2, etc. pennies. Thus, since there are 4 coins in each row, we need total coins.           How many 12-bit strings contain 8 or more 1 s?        Count the number of strings with each permissible number of 1 s separately, then add them up. So there are strings.         How many subsets of have cardinality 8 or more?   Break the question into 3 cases.        This is the same as a question about 8-bit strings, since we can think of each subset as a 8-bit string with a 1 representing that we include that element in the subset. subsets.

This gives us for the coefficient resulting from this term.

Streets run east-west, and avenues north-south, for the entire stretch of the town, never curving and never interrupted by parks or schools or the like.  Suppose you live on the corner of 5th and 5th and work on the corner of 16th and 16th. Thus you must travel 22 blocks to get to work as quickly as possible.   How many different routes can you take to work, assuming you want to get there as quickly as possible?

How many choices do you have for your calzone?    How many choices do you have for your calzone if you refuse to have green pepper as one of your toppings?    How many choices do you have for your calzone if you insist on having green pepper as one of your toppings?    How do the three questions above relate to each other? Do you see why this makes sense?                    choices, since you have to select a 6-element subset of the set of 13 toppings.    choices, since you must select 6 of the 12 non-green pepper toppings.    choices, since you must select 5 of the remaining 12 non-green pepper toppings to have in addition to the green pepper.    Note that choices, which makes sense because every 6-topping pizza either has green pepper or does not have green pepper as a topping.         "

How many different choices do you have? What if you wanted four different colored chips? How do these problems relate to the previous one?       permutation A permutation is a (possible) rearrangement of objects. For example, there are 6 permutations of the letters a, b, c : .  We know that we have them all listed above there are 3 choices for which letter we put first, then 2 choices for which letter comes next, which leaves only 1 choice for the last letter. The multiplicative principle says we multiply .    How many permutations are there of the letters a, b, c, d, e, f ?    We do NOT want to try to list all of these out. However, if we did, we would need to pick a letter to write down first. There are 6 choices for that letter. For each choice of first letter, there are 5 choices for the second letter (we cannot repeat the first letter; we are rearranging letters and only have one of each), and for each of those, there are 4 choices for the third, 3 choices for the fourth, 2 choices for the fifth and finally only 1 choice for the last letter. So there are permutations of the 6 letters.    A piece of notation is helpful here: , read factorial , factorial  is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to (for reasons of convenience, we also define 0! to be 1). So the number of permutation of 6 letters, as seen in the previous example is . This generalizes:   Permutations of elements  permutation of elements   There are permutations of (distinct) elements.    Counting Bijective Functions  bijection counting   permutation to count functions    How many functions are bijective ?    Remember what it means for a function to be bijective: each element in the codomain must be the image of exactly one element of the domain. Using two-line notation, we could write one of these bijections as . What we are really doing is just rearranging the elements of the codomain, so we are creating a permutation of 8 elements. In fact, permutation is another term used to describe bijective functions from a finite set to itself.  If you believe this, then you see the answer must be . You can see this directly as well: for each element of the domain, we must pick a distinct element of the codomain to map to. There are 8 choices for where to send 1, then 7 choices for where to send 2, and so on. We multiply using the multiplicative principle.    Sometimes we do not want to permute all of the letters\/numbers\/elements we are given.   permutation to count words   word (counting)    How many 4 letter words can you make from the letters a through g , with no repeated letters?    This is just like the problem of permuting 4 letters, only now we have more choices for each letter. For the first letter, there are 7 choices. For each of those, there are 6 choices for the second letter. Then there are 5 choices for the third letter and 4 choices for the last letter. The total number of words is .  This is not because we never multiplied by 3, 2, or 1. We could write it using though, if we cancel the 3, 2, and 1. Thus we could write the answer as .     permutation of elements chosen from -permutation of elements   -permutation of elements  In general, we can ask how many permutations exist of objects choosing those objects from a larger collection of objects. (In the example above, , and .) We write this number and sometimes call it a -permutation of elements .  From the example above, we see that to compute we must apply the multiplicative principle to numbers, starting with and counting backwards. For example .  Notice that starts out looking like , but we stop after 7. We can formally account for this stopping by dividing away the part of the factorial we do not want: .  Careful: The factorial in the denominator is not but rather .   -permutations of elements  -permutation of elements   permutation    is the number of -permutations of elements , the number of ways to arrange  objects chosen from distinct objects. .   Note that when , we have (since we defined to be 1). This makes sense we already know gives the number of permutations of all objects.   Counting injective functions  injection counting    How many functions are injective ?    Note that it doesn't make sense to ask for the number of bijections here, as there are none (because the codomain is larger than the domain, there are no surjections). But for a function to be injective, we just can't use an element of the codomain more than once.  We need to pick an element from the codomain to be the image of 1. There are 8 choices. Then we need to pick one of the remaining 7 elements to be the image of 2. Finally, one of the remaining 6 elements must be the image of 3. So the total number of functions is .  What this demonstrates in general is that the number of injections , where and , is .    Here is another way to find the number of -permutations of elements: first select which elements will be in the permutation, then count how many ways there are to arrange them. Once you have selected the objects, we know there are ways to arrange (permute) them. But how do you select objects from the ? You have objects, and you need to choose  of them. You can do that in ways. Then for each choice of those elements, we can permute them in ways. Using the multiplicative principle, we get another formula for : .  Now since we have a closed formula for already, we can substitute that in: .  If we divide both sides by we get a closed formula for .   Closed formula for  binomial coefficient closed formula for   combination closed formula for    .    combination vs permutation   permutation vs combination  We say counts permutations , and counts combinations . The formulas for each are very similar, there is just an extra in the denominator of . That extra accounts for the fact that does not distinguish between the different orders that the objects can appear in. We are just selecting (or choosing) the objects, not arranging them. Perhaps combination is a misleading label. We don't mean it like a combination lock (where the order would definitely matter). Perhaps a better metaphor is a combination of flavors you just need to decide which flavors to combine, not the order in which to combine them.  To further illustrate the connection between combinations and permutations, we close with an example.    combination  vs permutation    permutation  vs combination    You decide to have a dinner party. Even though you are incredibly popular and have 14 different friends, you only have enough chairs to invite 6 of them.     How many choices do you have for which 6 friends to invite?    What if you need to decide not only which friends to invite but also where to seat them along your long table? How many choices do you have then?          You must simply choose 6 friends from a group of 14. This can be done in ways. We can find this number either by using Pascal's triangle or the closed formula: .    Here you must count all the ways you can permute 6 friends chosen from a group of 14. So the answer is , which can be calculated as .  Notice that we can think of this counting problem as a question about counting functions: how many injective functions are there from your set of 6 chairs to your set of 14 friends (the functions are injective because you can't have a single chair go to two of your friends).     How are these numbers related? Notice that is much larger than . This makes sense. picks 6 friends, but arranges the 6 friends as well as picks them. In fact, we can say exactly how much larger is. In both counting problems we choose 6 out of 14 friends. For the first one, we stop there, at 3003 ways. But for the second counting problem, each of those 3003 choices of 6 friends can be arranged in exactly ways. So now we have choices and that is exactly .  Alternatively, look at the first problem another way. We want to select 6 out of 14 friends, but we do not care about the order they are selected in. To select 6 out of 14 friends, we might try this: .  This is a reasonable guess, since we have 14 choices for the first guest, then 13 for the second, and so on. But the guess is wrong (in fact, that product is exactly ). It distinguishes between the different orders in which we could invite the guests. To correct for this, we could divide by the number of different arrangements of the 6 guests (so that all of these would count as just one outcome). There are precisely ways to arrange 6 guests, so the correct answer to the first question is .  Note that another way to write this is . which is what we had originally.      True or false: The number of sequences of two distinct digits from 0-9 is twice the number of sets of two distinct digits from 0-9. Briefly explain.

Practice Problems    A pizza parlor offers 12 toppings.   How many 4-topping pizzas could they put on their menu? Assume double toppings are not allowed.    How many total pizzas are possible, with between zero and 12 toppings (but not double toppings) allowed?    The pizza parlor will list the 12 toppings in two equal-sized columns on their menu. How many ways can they arrange the toppings in the left column?                      pizzas. We must choose (in no particular order) 4 out of the 12 toppings.    pizzas. Say yes or no to each topping.    ways. Assign each of the 6 spots in the left column to a unique pizza topping.           A combination lock consists of a dial with 45 numbers on it. To open the lock, you turn the dial to the right until you reach the first number, then to the left until you get to the second number, then to the right again to the third number. The numbers must be distinct. How many different combinations are possible?        Despite its name, we are not looking for a combination here. The order in which the three numbers appears matters. There are different possibilities for the combination . This is assuming you cannot repeat any of the numbers (if you could, the answer would be ).         Using the digits 2 through 9, find the number of different 6-digit numbers such that:   Digits can be used more than once.    Digits cannot be repeated, but can come in any order.    Digits cannot be repeated and must be written in increasing order.                      This is just the multiplicative principle. There are 8 digits which we can select for each of the 6 positions, so we have such numbers.    Now we have 8 choices for the first number, 7 for the second, etc. So there are such numbers.    To build such a number we simply must select 6 different digits. After doing so, there will only be one way to arrange them into increasing order. Thus there are such numbers.           In an attempt to clean up your room, you have purchased a new floating shelf to put some of your 28 books you have stacked in a corner. These books are all by different authors. The new book shelf is large enough to hold 13 of the books. Warning: before answering the next two questions, ask yourself which answer should be larger.   How many ways can you select and arrange 13 of the 28 books on the shelf? Notice that here we will allow the books to end up in any order.    How many ways can you arrange 13 of the 28 books on the shelf if you insist they must be arranged alphabetically by author?                 We can write the answer as , which is the same as . Or, if you think of picking the 13 books and then arranging those 13, you can write this as . Note, that since any order is acceptable, we are distinguishing between different orders, so a permutation is appropriate here.    Here we just need to select the books, and have no choice as how to arrange them. So the answer is just            An anagram of a word is just a rearrangement of its letters. How many different anagrams of bankruptcies are there?        Since there are 12 different letters in bankruptcies , we have 12 choices for the first letter, 11 for the next, 10 for the next, and so on. Thus there are anagrams.         How many anagrams are there of the word seeded that start with the letter s ?        After the first letter (s), we must rearrange the remaining 5 letters. There are only two choices of letter now, so this is really just a bit-string question where one of the letters is 0, and the other letter is 1. Thus there are anagrams starting with s .         How many anagrams are there of attest ?        First, decide where to put the t s. There are 6 positions, and we must choose 3 of them to fill with an t . This can be done in ways. The remaining 3 spots all get a different letter, so there are ways to finish off the anagram. This gives a total of anagrams. Strangely enough, this is 120, which is also equal to To get the answer that way, start by picking one of the 6 positions to be filled by the first non- t letter, one of the remaining 7 positions to be filled by the next, and so on. Then put t s in the remaining 3 positions.          On a business retreat, your company of 28 businessmen and businesswomen go golfing.   You need to divide up into foursomes (groups of 4 people): a first foursome, a second foursome, and so on. How many ways can you do this?    After all your hard work, you realize that in fact, you want each foursome to include one of the 7 Board members. How many ways can you do this?                 ways. Pick 4 out of 28 people to be in the first foursome, then 4 of the remaining 24 for the second foursome, and so on (use the multiplicative principle to combine).    ways. First determine the tee time of the 7 board members, then select 3 of the 21 non board members to golf with the first board member, then 3 of the remaining 18 to golf with the second, and so on.           How many different seating arrangements are possible for King Arthur and his 11 knights around their round table?

What if you need to decide not only which friends to invite but also where to seat them along your long table? How many choices do you have then?          You must simply choose 6 friends from a group of 14. This can be done in ways. We can find this number either by using Pascal's triangle or the closed formula: .    Here you must count all the ways you can permute 6 friends chosen from a group of 14. So the answer is , which can be calculated as .  Notice that we can think of this counting problem as a question about counting functions: how many injective functions are there from your set of 6 chairs to your set of 14 friends (the functions are injective because you can't have a single chair go to two of your friends).     How are these numbers related? Notice that is much larger than . This makes sense. picks 6 friends, but arranges the 6 friends as well as picks them. In fact, we can say exactly how much larger is. In both counting problems we choose 6 out of 14 friends. For the first one, we stop there, at 3003 ways. But for the second counting problem, each of those 3003 choices of 6 friends can be arranged in exactly ways. So now we have choices and that is exactly .  Alternatively, look at the first problem another way. We want to select 6 out of 14 friends, but we do not care about the order they are selected in. To select 6 out of 14 friends, we might try this: .  This is a reasonable guess, since we have 14 choices for the first guest, then 13 for the second, and so on. But the guess is wrong (in fact, that product is exactly ). It distinguishes between the different orders in which we could invite the guests. To correct for this, we could divide by the number of different arrangements of the 6 guests (so that all of these would count as just one outcome). There are precisely ways to arrange 6 guests, so the correct answer to the first question is .  Note that another way to write this is . which is what we had originally.   "

One approach would be to write an outcome as a string of four numbers like this: , which represent the outcome in which the first kid gets 3 cookies, the second and third kid each get 1 cookie, and the fourth kid gets 2 cookies. Represented this way, the order in which the numbers occur matters. 1312 is a different outcome, because the first kid gets a one cookie instead of 3. Each number in the string can be any integer between 0 and 7. But the answer is not . We need the sum of the numbers to be 7.  Another way we might represent outcomes is to write a string of seven letters: , which represents that the first cookie goes to kid A, the second cookie goes to kid B, the third and fourth cookies go to kid A, and so on. In fact, this outcome is identical to the previous one A gets 3 cookies, B and C get 1 each and D gets 2. Each of the seven letters in the string can be any of the 4 possible letters (one for each kid), but the number of such strings is not , because here order does not matter. In fact, another way to write the same outcome is .  This will be the preferred representation of the outcome. Since we can write the letters in any order, we might as well write them in alphabetical order for the purposes of counting. So we will write all the A's first, then all the B's, and so on.  Now think about how you could specify such an outcome. All we really need to do is say when to switch from one letter to the next. In terms of cookies, we need to say after how many cookies do we stop giving cookies to the first kid and start giving cookies to the second kid. And then after how many do we switch to the third kid? And after how many do we switch to the fourth? So yet another way to represent an outcome is like this: .  Three cookies go to the first kid, then we switch and give one cookie to the second kid, then switch, one to the third kid, switch, two to the fourth kid. Notice that we need 7 stones and 3 sticks one stone for each cookie, and one stick for each switch between kids, so one fewer sticks than there are kids (we don't need to switch after the last kid we are done).  Why have we done all of this? Simple: to count the number of ways to distribute 7 cookies to 4 kids, all we need to do is count how many sticks and stones charts there are. But a sticks and stones chart  sticks and stones chart is just a string of symbols, some sticks and some stones. If instead of sticks and stones we would use 0's and 1's, it would just be a bit string. bit string relation to sticks and stones We know how to count those.  Before we get too excited, we should make sure that really any string of (in our case) 7 stones and 3 sticks corresponds to a different way to distribute cookies to kids. In particular consider a string like this: .  Does that correspond to a cookie distribution? Yes. It represents the distribution in which kid A gets 0 cookies (because we switch to kid B before any stones), kid B gets three cookies (three stones before the next bar), kid C gets 0 cookies (no stones before the next bar) and kid D gets the remaining 4 cookies. No matter how the sticks and stones are arranged, we can distribute cookies in that way. Also, given any way to distribute cookies, we can represent that with a sticks and stones chart. For example, the distribution in which kid A gets 6 cookies and kid B gets 1 cookie has the following chart: .  After all that work we are finally ready to count. Each way to distribute cookies corresponds to a sticks and stones chart with 7 stones and 3 sticks. So there are 10 symbols, and we must choose 3 of them to be sticks. Thus: .  While we are at it, we can also answer a related question: how many ways are there to distribute 7 cookies to 4 kids so that each kid gets at least one cookie? What can you say about the corresponding sticks and stones charts? The charts must start and end with at least one star (so that kids A and D) get cookies, and also no two sticks can be adjacent (so that kids B and C are not skipped). One way to assure this is to place sticks only in the spaces between the stones. With 7 stones, there are 6 spots between the stones, so we must choose 3 of those 6 spots to fill with bars. Thus there are ways to distribute 7 cookies to 4 kids giving at least one cookie to each kid.  Another (and more general) way to approach this modified problem is to first give each kid one cookie. Now the remaining 3 cookies can be distributed to the 4 kids without restrictions. So we have 3 stones and 3 sticks for a total of 6 symbols, 3 of which must be bars. So again we see that there are ways to distribute the cookies.  Sticks and stones can be used in counting problems other than kids and cookies. Here are a few examples:   distribution (counting)   Your favorite mathematical ice-cream parlor offers 10 flavors. How many milkshakes could you create using exactly 6, not necessarily distinct scoops? The order you add the flavors does not matter (they will be blended up anyway) but you are allowed repeats. So one possible shake is triple chocolate, double cherry, and mint chocolate chip.    We get six scoops, each of which could be one of ten possible flavors. Represent each scoop as a star. Think of going down the counter one flavor at a time: you see vanilla first, and skip to the next, chocolate. You say yes to chocolate three times (use three stones), then switch to the next flavor. You keep skipping until you get to cherry, which you say yes to twice. Another switch and you are at mint chocolate chip. You say yes once. Then you keep switching until you get past the last flavor, never saying yes again (since you already have said yes six times). There are ten flavors to choose from, so we must switch from considering one flavor to the next nine times. These are the nine bars.  Now that we are confident that we have the right number of sticks and stones, we answer the question simply: there are 6 stones and 9 bars, so 15 symbols. We need to pick 9 of them to be bars, so the number of milkshakes possible is .      How many 7 digit phone numbers are there in which the digits are non-increasing? That is, every digit is less than or equal to the previous one.    We need to decide on 7 digits so we will use 7 stones. The sticks will represent a switch from each possible single digit number down to the next smaller one. So the phone number 866-5221 is represented by the sticks and stones chart .  There are 10 choices for each digit (0-9) so we must switch between choices 9 times. We have 7 stones and 9 bars, so the total number of phone numbers is .     integer solutions to equation (counting)   How many integer solutions are there to the equation .  (An integer solution to an equation is a solution in which the unknown must have an integer value.)     where for each ?    where for each ?    where for each ?       This problem is just like giving 13 cookies to 5 kids. We need to say how many of the 13 units go to each of the 5 variables. In other words, we have 13 stones and 4 bars (the sticks are like the + signs in the equation).     If can be 0 or greater, we are in the standard case with no restrictions. So 13 stones and 4 sticks can be arranged in ways.    Now each variable must be at least 1. So give one unit to each variable to satisfy that restriction. Now there are 8 stones left, and still 4 bars, so the number of solutions is .    Now each variable must be 2 or greater. So before any counting, give each variable 2 units. We now have 3 remaining stones and 4 bars, so there are solutions.        Counting with Functions  function counting  Many of the counting problems in this section might at first appear to be examples of counting functions . After all, when we try to count the number of ways to distribute cookies to kids, we are assigning each cookie to a kid, just like you assign elements of the domain of a function to elements in the codomain. However, the number of ways to assign 7 cookies to 4 kids is , while the number of functions is . What is going on here?  When we count functions, we consider the following two functions, for example, to be different: . But these two functions would correspond to the same cookie distribution: kids and each get one cookie, kid gets the rest (and none for kid ).  The point: elements of the domain are distinguished, cookies are indistinguishable. This is analogous to the distinction between permutations (like counting functions) and combinations (not).      Which of the following counting questions are NOT an example of a question you would use sticks and stones to solve?     How many ways can you distribute six unique gifts to three friends?    Correct. Because the gifts are distinct, we have three choices for the first gift, three for the second, etc, making the answer .      How many ways can you distribute six identical gifts to three friends?    You can use sticks and stones here: use two sticks to separate your three friends, and use six stones for the gifts.      How many different combinations of numbers can you get if you roll three identical 6-side dice?    Use five sticks to separate the six values on the dice. Each stone represents one of the identical dice.      How many different three-scoop milkshakes can you make when each scoop of ice-cream can be one of six different flavors?    Use five sticks and three stones!      When you count outcomes using sticks and stones, does order matter? Do you allow repeats? What do you mean by your answers (the order of what, the repeat of what)?     Practice Problems  multiset counting   A multiset is a collection of objects, just like a set, but can contain an object more than once (the order of the elements still doesn t matter). For example, is a multiset of size 6.   How many sets of size 8 can be made using the 10 numeric digits 0 through 9?    How many multi sets of size 8 can be made using the 10 numeric digits 0 through 9?                 sets. We must select 8 of the 10 digits to put in the set.    Use stars and bars: each star represents one of the 8 elements of the set, each bar represents a switch between digits. So there are 8 stars and 9 bars, giving us sets.           Using the digits 2 through 9, find the number of different 4-digit numbers such that:   Digits cannot be repeated and must be written in increasing order. ( Increasing means strictly increasing. For example, the digits of 134 are increasing, but the digits of 133 are not.)    Digits can be repeated and must be written in non-decreasing order. (Now the digits don t need to be strictly increasing; 133 has digits non-decreasing.)                 There are numbers. We simply choose 4 of the 8 digits and once chosen put them in increasing order.    This requires stars and bars. Use a star to represent each of the 4 digits in the number, and use their position relative to the bars to say what numeral fills that spot. So we will have 4 stars and 7 bars, giving numbers.           After gym class you are tasked with putting the 33 identical dodgeballs away into 9 bins.   How many ways can you do this if there are no restrictions?    How many ways can you do this if each bin must contain at least one dodgeball?                 ways. Each outcome can be represented by a sequence of 33 stars and 8 bars.    ways. First put one ball in each bin. This leaves 24 stars and 8 bars.           How many integer solutions are there to the equation for which    and are all positive?     and are all non-negative?     and are all greater than or equal to                      solutions. After each variable gets 1 star for free, we are left with 3 stars and 2 bars.    solutions. We have 6 stars and 2 bars.    solutions. This problem is equivalent to finding the number of solutions to where  and are non-negative. (In fact, we really just do a substitution. Let  and ).           When playing Yahtzee, you roll five regular 6-sided dice. How many different outcomes are possible from a single roll? The order of the dice does not matter.  When playing Super-Yahtzee, you roll 3 regular 5-sided dice. Now how any different outcomes are possible from a single roll?             outcomes are possible in traditional Yahtzee. Each die is a star, its value is determined by where it is put relative to the bars.  For Super-Yahtzee, outcomes. We have 3 stars (the 3 dice) and 4 bars (the 4 switches between the numbers 1-5).         Your friend tells you she has 12 coins in her hand (just pennies, nickels, dimes and quarters). If you guess how many of each kind of coin she has, she will give them to you. If you guess randomly, what is the probability that you will be correct?   The probability will be 1 divided by however many different combinations of 12 coins your friend could have.        We must figure out how many different combinations of 12 coins are possible. Let a star represent each coin, and a bar represent switching between type of coin. For example, if we have 7 coins, represents 2 pennies, one nickel, no dimes and 4 quarters. The number of such star and bar diagrams for 15 total stars and bars (with 12 stars and 3 bars) is Thus you have a 1 in 0.0021978 chance of guessing correctly.         How many integer solutions to are there for which   and        solutions. First we guarantee the restrictions on the variables by distributing 15 units to the variables. The we find all solutions to in non-negative integers.       function increasing counting function non-decreasing counting   Consider functions    How many of these functions are strictly increasing? Explain. (A function is strictly increasing provided if then )    How many of the functions are non-decreasing? Explain. (A function is non-decreasing provided if then )                 Note that a strictly increasing function is automatically injective. So the 3 outputs must all be different. So let s first pick which 3 outputs we will use: there are ways to do this. Now how many ways are there to assign those outputs to the inputs through 3? Only one way, since there is only one way to arrange numbers in increasing order.    This is in fact a stars and bars problem. The stars are the 3 inputs and the bars are the 7 spots between the 8 possible outputs. Think of it this way - we will specify then then and so on in that order. Start with the possible output 0. We can use it as the output of or we can switch to 1 as a potential output. Say we put Now we are at 1 (can t go back to 0). Should If yes, then we are putting down another star. If no, put down a bar and switch to 2. Maybe you switch to 3, then assign and (two more stars) before switching to 4 as a possible output. And so on.           Conic , your favorite math themed fast food drive-in offers 25 flavors which can be added to your soda. You have enough money to buy a large soda with 6 added flavors. How many different soda concoctions can you order if:   You refuse to use any of the flavors more than once?    You refuse repeats but care about the order the flavors are added?    You allow yourself multiple shots of the same flavor?    You allow yourself multiple shots, and care about the order the flavors are added?                           sodas (order does not matter and repeats are not allowed).    sodas (order matters and repeats are not allowed).    sodas (order does not matter and repeats are allowed; 6 stars and 24 bars).    sodas (order matters and repeats are allowed; 25 choices 6 times).           Additional Exercises   Each of the counting problems below can be solved with sticks and stones. For each, say what outcome the diagram represents, if there are the correct number of sticks and stones for the problem. Otherwise, say why the diagram does not represent any outcome, and what a correct diagram would look like.   How many ways are there to select a handful of 6 jellybeans from a jar that contains 5 different flavors?    How many ways can you distribute 5 identical lollipops to 6 kids?    How many 6-letter words can you make using the 5 vowels in alphabetical order?    How many solutions are there to the equation .         You take 3 strawberry, 1 lime, 0 licorice, 2 blueberry and 0 bubblegum.    This is backwards. We don't want the stones to represent the kids because the kids are not identical, but the stones are. Instead we should use 5 stones (for the lollipops) and use 5 sticks to switch between the 6 kids. For example, would represent the outcome with the first kid getting 2 lollipops, the third kid getting 3, and the rest of the kids getting none.    This is the word AAAEOO.    This doesn't represent a solution. Each stone should represent one of the 6 units that add up to 6, and the sticks should switch between the different variables. We have one too many sticks. An example of a correct diagram would be , representing that , , , and .       Solve the three counting problems below. Then say why it makes sense that they all have the same answer. That is, say how you can interpret them as each other.   How many ways are there to distribute 8 cookies to 3 kids?    How many solutions in non-negative integers are there to ?    How many different packs of 8 crayons can you make using crayons that come in red, blue and yellow?       "

Let's answer this question two ways:   How many of the 7 games does your team need to win? How many ways can this happen?    What if the tournament goes all 7 games? So you win the last game. How many ways can the first 6 games go down?    What if the tournament goes just 6 games? How many ways can this happen? What about 5 games? 4 games?    What are the two different ways to compute the number of ways your team can win? Write down an equation involving binomial coefficients (that is, 's). What pattern in Pascal's triangle is this an example of?       Generalize. What if the rules changed and you played a best of tournament (5 wins required)? What if you played an game tournament with wins required to be named champion?        Patterns in Pascal's Triangle   Pascal's triangle  patterns in   Have a look again at Pascal's triangle. Forget for a moment where it comes from. Just look at it as a mathematical object. What do you notice?     The first 7 rows of Pascal's Triangle. A triangular array of hexagons, each row containing one more hexagon that the row above it. In each hexagon is an integer: 1's on the border of the triangle, and every integer inside the triangle the sum of the two integers above it. The last row contains the numbers 1, 7, 21, 35, 35, 21, 7, and 1.    There are lots of patterns hidden away in the triangle, enough to fill a reasonably sized book. Here are just a few of the most obvious ones:   The entries on the border of the triangle are all 1.    Any entry not on the border is the sum of the two entries above it.    The triangle is symmetric. In any row, entries on the left side are mirrored on the right side.    The sum of all entries on a given row is a power of 2. (You should check this!)     We would like to state these observations in a more precise way, and then prove that they are correct. Now each entry in Pascal's triangle is in fact a binomial coefficient. The 1 on the very top of the triangle is . The next row (which we will call row 1, even though it is not the top-most row) consists of and . Row 4 (the row 1, 4, 6, 4, 1) consists of the binomial coefficients .  Given this description of the elements in Pascal's triangle, we can rewrite the above observations as follows:  binomial identity  examples of     and .   .  .   .    Each of these is an example of a binomial identity   binomial identity  : an identity (i.e., equation) involving binomial coefficients.  Our goal is to establish these identities. We wish to prove that they hold for all values of and . These proofs can be done in many ways. One option would be to give algebraic proofs, using the formula for : .  Here's how you might do that for the second identity above.    Give an algebraic proof for the binomial identity .     By the definition of , we have and .  Thus, starting with the right-hand side of the equation: .  The second line (where the common denominator is found) works because and .     This is certainly a valid proof, but also is entirely useless. Even if you understand the proof perfectly, it does not tell you why the identity is true. A better approach would be to explain what  means and then say why that is also what means. Let's see how this works for the four identities we observed above.    Explain why and .    What do these binomial coefficients tell us? Well, gives the number of ways to select 0 objects from a collection of objects. There is only one way to do this, namely to not select any of the objects. Thus . Similarly, gives the number of ways to select objects from a collection of objects. There is only one way to do this: select all objects. Thus .  Alternatively, we know that is the number of -bit strings with weight 0. There is only one such string, the string of all 0's. So . Similarly is the number of -bit strings with weight . There is only one string with this property, the string of all 1's.  Another way: gives the number of subsets of a set of size containing 0 elements. There is only one such subset, the empty set. gives the number of subsets containing elements. The only such subset is the original set (of all elements).      Explain why .    The easiest way to see this is to consider bit strings. is the number of bit strings of length containing 1's. Of all of these strings, some start with a 1 and the rest start with a 0. First consider all the bit strings which start with a 1. After the 1, there must be more bits (to get the total length up to ) and exactly of them must be 1's (as we already have one, and we need total). How many strings are there like that? There are exactly such bit strings, so of all the length bit strings containing 1's, of them start with a 1. Similarly, there are which start with a 0 (we still need bits and now of them must be 1's). Since there are bit strings containing bits with 1's, that is the number of length bit strings with 1's which start with a 0. Therefore .  Another way: consider the question, how many ways can you select pizza toppings from a menu containing choices? One way to do this is just . Another way to answer the same question is to first decide whether or not you want anchovies. If you do want anchovies, you still need to pick toppings, now from just choices. That can be done in ways. If you do not want anchovies, then you still need to select toppings from choices (the anchovies are out). You can do that in ways. Since the choices with anchovies are disjoint from the choices without anchovies, the total choices are . But wait. We answered the same question in two different ways, so the two answers must be the same. Thus .  You can also explain (prove) this identity by counting subsets, or even lattice paths.      Prove the binomial identity .    Why is this true? counts the number of ways to select things from choices. On the other hand, counts the number of ways to select things from choices. Are these really the same? Well, what if instead of selecting the things you choose to exclude them. How many ways are there to choose things to exclude from choices? Clearly this is as well (it doesn't matter whether you include or exclude the things once you have chosen them). And if you exclude things, then you are including the other things. So the set of outcomes should be the same.  Let's try the pizza counting example like we did above. How many ways are there to pick toppings from a list of choices? On the one hand, the answer is simply . Alternatively, you could make a list of all the toppings you don't want. To end up with a pizza containing exactly toppings, you need to pick toppings to not put on the pizza. You have choices for the toppings you don't want. Both of these ways give you a pizza with toppings, in fact all the ways to get a pizza with toppings. Thus these two answers must be the same: .  You can also prove (explain) this identity using bit strings, subsets, or lattice paths. The bit string argument is nice: counts the number of bit strings of length with 1's. This is also the number of bit string of length with 0's (just replace each 1 with a 0 and each 0 with a 1). But if a string of length has 0's, it must have 1's. And there are exactly strings of length with 1's.      Prove the binomial identity .    Let's do a pizza proof again. We need to find a question about pizza toppings which has as the answer. How about this: If a pizza joint offers toppings, how many pizzas can you build using any number of toppings from no toppings to all toppings, using each topping at most once?  On one hand, the answer is . For each topping you can say yes or no, so you have two choices for each topping.  On the other hand, divide the possible pizzas into disjoint groups: the pizzas with no toppings, the pizzas with one topping, the pizzas with two toppings, etc. If we want no toppings, there is only one pizza like that (the empty pizza, if you will) but it would be better to think of that number as since we choose 0 of the toppings. How many pizzas have 1 topping? We need to choose 1 of the toppings, so . We have:    Pizzas with 0 toppings:  Pizzas with 1 topping:  Pizzas with 2 toppings:     Pizzas with toppings: .    The total number of possible pizzas will be the sum of these, which is exactly the left-hand side of the identity we are trying to prove.  Again, we could have proved the identity using subsets, bit strings, or lattice paths (although the lattice path argument is a little tricky).    Hopefully this gives some idea of how explanatory proofs of binomial identities can go. It is worth pointing out that more traditional proofs can also be beautiful. Most every binomial identity can be proved using mathematical induction, using the recursive definition for . We will discuss induction in . For example, consider the following rather slick proof of the last identity.  Expand the binomial : .  Let and . We get: .  Of course this simplifies to: .  Something fun to try: Let and . Neat huh?    More Proofs    combinatorial proof    proof  combinatorial  The explanatory proofs given in the above examples are typically called combinatorial proofs . In general, to give a combinatorial proof for a binomial identity, say you do the following:     Find a counting problem you will be able to answer in two ways.    Explain why one answer to the counting problem is .    Explain why the other answer to the counting problem is .     Since both and are the answers to the same question, we must have .  The tricky thing is coming up with the question. This is not always obvious, but it gets easier the more counting problems you solve. You will start to recognize types of answers as the answers to types of questions. More often what will happen is you will be solving a counting problem and happen to think up two different ways of finding the answer. Now you have a binomial identity and the proof is right there. The proof is the problem you just solved together with your two solutions.  For example, consider this counting question:   How many 10-letter words use exactly four A's, three B's, two C's and one D?   Let's try to solve this problem. We have 10 spots for letters to go. Four of those need to be A's. We can pick the four A-spots in ways. Now where can we put the B's? Well there are only 6 spots left, we need to pick of them. This can be done in ways. The two C's need to go in two of the 3 remaining spots, so we have ways of doing that. That leaves just one spot of the D, but we could write that 1 choice as . Thus the answer is: .  But why stop there? We can find the answer another way too. First let's decide where to put the one D: we have 10 spots, we need to choose 1 of them, so this can be done in ways. Next, choose one of the ways to place the two C's. We now have spots left, and three of them need to be filled with B's. There are ways to do this. Finally the A's can be placed in (that is, only one) ways. So another answer to the question is .  Interesting. This gives us the binomial identity: .  Here are a couple more binomial identities with combinatorial proofs.    Prove the identity .    To give a combinatorial proof we need to think up a question we can answer in two ways: one way needs to give the left-hand-side of the identity, the other way needs to be the right-hand-side of the identity. Our clue to what question to ask comes from the right-hand side: counts the number of ways to select 3 things from a group of things. Let's name those things . In other words, we want to find 3-element subsets of those numbers (since order should not matter, subsets are exactly the right thing to think about). We will have to be a bit clever to explain why the left-hand-side also gives the number of these subsets. Here's the proof.   Consider the question How many 3-element subsets are there of the set ? We answer this in two ways:  Answer 1: We must select 3 elements from the collection of elements. This can be done in ways.  Answer 2: Break this problem up into cases by what the middle number in the subset is. Say each subset is written in increasing order. We count the number of subsets for each distinct value of . The smallest possible value of is , and the largest is .  When , there are subsets: 1 choice for and choices (3 through ) for .  When , there are subsets: 2 choices for and choices for .  When , there are subsets: 3 choices for and choices for .  And so on. When , there are choices for and only 1 choice for , so subsets.  Therefore the total number of subsets is .  Since Answer 1 and Answer 2 are answers to the same question, they must be equal. Therefore .       Prove the binomial identity .    We will give two different proofs of this fact. The first will be very similar to the previous example (counting subsets). The second proof is a little slicker, using lattice paths.   Consider the question: How many pizzas can you make using toppings when there are toppings to choose from?   Answer 1: There are toppings, from which you must choose . This can be done in ways.  Answer 2: Divide the toppings into two groups of toppings (perhaps meats and veggies). Any choice of toppings must include some number from the first group and some number from the second group. Consider each possible number of meat toppings separately:  0 meats: , since you need to choose 0 of the meats and of the veggies.  1 meat: , since you need 1 of meats so of veggies.  2 meats: . Choose 2 meats and the remaining toppings from the veggies.  And so on. The last case is meats, which can be done in ways.  Thus the total number of pizzas possible is .  This is not quite the left-hand side yet. Notice that and and so on, by the identity in . Thus we do indeed get .  Since these two answers are answers to the same question, they must be equal, and thus .   For an alternative proof, we use lattice paths. This is reasonable to consider because the right-hand side of the identity reminds us of the number of paths from to .   Consider the question: How many lattice paths are there from to ?  Answer 1: We must travel steps, and of them must be in the up direction. Thus there are paths.  Answer 2: Note that any path from to must cross the line . That is, any path must pass through exactly one of the points: , , , , . For example, this is what happens in the case :     A light gray grid with points (0,0) and (4,4) identified in the lower left and upper right corners respectively. The line x + y = 4 is shown extending from the top left to bottom right corner. The line intersects the labeled points (0,4), (1,3), (2,2), (3,1), and (4,0).    How many paths pass through ? To get to that point, you must travel units, and of them are to the right, so there are ways to get to . From to takes steps, and of them are up. So there are ways to get from to . Therefore there are paths from to through the point .  What about through . There are paths to get there ( steps, 1 to the right) and paths to complete the journey to ( steps, up). So there are paths from to through .  In general, to get to through the point we have paths to the midpoint and then paths from the midpoint to . So there are paths from to through .  All together then the total paths from to passing through exactly one of these midpoints is .  Since these two answers are answers to the same question, they must be equal, and thus .        Which of the following describes the overall strategy for a combinatorial proof?     Ask a counting question that can be answered in two ways (and answer it).    Correct. Each way of answering the question should be one side of the identity.      Ask two counting questions that can both answered in the same way (and answer the questions).    Not quite. You use combinatorial proofs to establish an identity that has two different sides.       Simplify the algebraic expressions for each side of the combinatorial identity.    While some identities can be established with an algebraic proof, this is not what a combinatorial proof uses.      Assume the identity fails to hold for some smallest value, and get a contradiction by looking at a smaller value.    This would be a minimal-criminal style argument, which might also be a valid proof, but not what we mean by a combinatorial proof.      Write a counting question that you could use to establish the identity: .      Create a combinatorial proof of the identity .    Consider the question How many two-digit numbers start with a 3 or 4?  Consider the question How many 2-topping pizzas can you make choosing from 10 toppings?    The first way to answer this is .     This is because there are 10 numbers that start with 3, and another 10 that start with 4.    This is because there are 10 choices for the first topping, and 10 choices for the second topping.     A second answer to the question is .     This is because you have 2 choices for the first digit, and 10 choices for the second digit.    This is because you must either choose 2 identical toppings or two different toppings.     Since both expressions answer the same question, they must be equal. Therefore .     Give a combinatorial proof of the identity .    Question: How many 2-letter words start with a , b , or c and end with either y or z ?  Answer 1: There are two words that start with a , two that start with b , two that start with c , for a total of .  Answer 2: There are three choices for the first letter and two choices for the second letter, for a total of .  Since the two answers are both answers to the same question, they are equal. Thus .    bow ties  Suppose you own fezzes and bow ties. Of course, and are both greater than 1.   How many combinations of fez and bow tie can you make?

Twelve dots arranged in a half circle. Seven dots lie on the horizontal diameter of the circle, the remaining five lie on the circumference of the circle.       Find an expression for the answer which is the sum of three terms involving binomial coefficients.    Find an expression for the answer which is the difference of two binomial coefficients.    Generalize the above to state and prove a binomial identity using a combinatorial proof. Say you have points on the horizontal axis and points in the semi-circle.      There will be 185 triangles. But to find them    How many vertices of the triangle can be on the horizontal axis?    Will any three dots work as the vertices?       Consider all the triangles you can create using the points shown below as vertices. Note, we are not allowing degenerate triangles (ones with all three vertices on the same line) but we do allow non-right triangles.     Five equally spaced dots in a vertical line and six additional equally spaced dots extending to the right in a horizontal line from the lowest dot (forming a right angle).       Find the number of triangles, and explain why your answer is correct.    Find the number of triangles again, using a different method. Explain why your new method works.

How many ways can she do this?    What if she first selects the 6 bridesmaids, and then selects one of them to be the maid of honor?    What if she first selects her maid of honor, and then 5 other bridesmaids?    Explain why .        She has ways to select the 6 bridesmaids, and then for each way, has 6 choices for the maid of honor. Thus she has choices.    She has 15 choices for who will be her maid of honor. Then she needs to select 5 of the remaining 14 friends to be bridesmaids, which she can do in ways. Thus she has choices.    We have answered the question (how many wedding parties can the bride choose from) in two ways. The first way gives the left-hand side of the identity and the second way gives the right-hand side of the identity. Therefore the identity holds.       Consider the identity: .   Is this true?

Question: You have a large container filled with ping-pong balls, all with a different number on them. You must select of the balls, putting two of them in a jar and the others in a box. How many ways can you do this?  Answer 1: First select 2 of the balls to put in the jar. Then select of the remaining balls to put in the box. The first task can be completed in different ways, the second task in ways. Thus there are ways to select the balls.  Answer 2: First select balls from the in the container. Then pick 2 of the balls you picked to put in the jar, placing the remaining in the box. The first task can be completed in ways, the second task in ways. Thus there are ways to select the balls.  Since both answers count the same thing, they must be equal and the identity is established.     Consider the binomial identity .   Give a combinatorial proof of this identity.

This one might remind you of     In we established that the sum of any row in Pascal's triangle is a power of two. Specifically, . The argument given there used the counting question, how many pizzas can you build using any number of different toppings? To practice, give new proofs of this identity using different questions.   Use a question about counting subsets.    Use a question about counting bit strings.    Use a question about counting lattice paths.      For the lattice paths, think about what sort of paths would count. Not all the paths will end at the same point, but you could describe the set of end points as a line.     Activity: Combinatorial Proofs    It is often possible to find the answer to a counting question in two different ways. Doing so results in two formulas that give the answer, which might look different, but must be equal (since they are both the correct answer to the same question). This provides a proof of the equality of the two formulas, called a combinatorial proof .  Let's explore a couple examples of this.     Consider the set of 7-bit strings of weight 3. That is, strings of 0s and 1s that are seven characters long and have exactly three 1s. How many such strings are there?   Give the answer as a single binomial coefficient.       Now count just those 7-bit strings of weight 3 that start with a 1. How many are there?       Now count just those 7-bit strings of weight 3 that start with 01. How many are there?       Now count just those 7-bit strings of weight 3 that start with 001. How many are there?       Continue this process until you have counted all 7-bit strings of weight 3, as a sum of binomial coefficients. What is this sum?               Consider the counting question How many ways can you permute the letters of the word STATISTICS ? Note that this is not just a permutation, since there are repeated letters.   How many ways can you select three of the ten positions in the anagram to be occupied by the letter S ?       How many ways can you select three of the remaining seven positions in the anagram to be occupied by the letter T ?

Of all of these strings, some start with a 1 and the rest start with a 0. First consider all the bit strings which start with a 1. After the 1, there must be more bits (to get the total length up to ) and exactly of them must be 1's (as we already have one, and we need total). How many strings are there like that? There are exactly such bit strings, so of all the length bit strings containing 1's, of them start with a 1. Similarly, there are which start with a 0 (we still need bits and now of them must be 1's). Since there are bit strings containing bits with 1's, that is the number of length bit strings with 1's which start with a 0. Therefore .  Another way: consider the question, how many ways can you select pizza toppings from a menu containing choices? One way to do this is just . Another way to answer the same question is to first decide whether or not you want anchovies. If you do want anchovies, you still need to pick toppings, now from just choices. That can be done in ways. If you do not want anchovies, then you still need to select toppings from choices (the anchovies are out). You can do that in ways. Since the choices with anchovies are disjoint from the choices without anchovies, the total choices are . But wait. We answered the same question in two different ways, so the two answers must be the same. Thus .  You can also explain (prove) this identity by counting subsets, or even lattice paths.   "

Are these really the same? Well, what if instead of selecting the things you choose to exclude them. How many ways are there to choose things to exclude from choices? Clearly this is as well (it doesn't matter whether you include or exclude the things once you have chosen them). And if you exclude things, then you are including the other things. So the set of outcomes should be the same.  Let's try the pizza counting example like we did above. How many ways are there to pick toppings from a list of choices? On the one hand, the answer is simply . Alternatively, you could make a list of all the toppings you don't want. To end up with a pizza containing exactly toppings, you need to pick toppings to not put on the pizza. You have choices for the toppings you don't want. Both of these ways give you a pizza with toppings, in fact all the ways to get a pizza with toppings. Thus these two answers must be the same: .  You can also prove (explain) this identity using bit strings, subsets, or lattice paths. The bit string argument is nice: counts the number of bit strings of length with 1's. This is also the number of bit string of length with 0's (just replace each 1 with a 0 and each 0 with a 1). But if a string of length has 0's, it must have 1's.

On one hand, the answer is . For each topping you can say yes or no, so you have two choices for each topping.  On the other hand, divide the possible pizzas into disjoint groups: the pizzas with no toppings, the pizzas with one topping, the pizzas with two toppings, etc. If we want no toppings, there is only one pizza like that (the empty pizza, if you will) but it would be better to think of that number as since we choose 0 of the toppings.

To give a combinatorial proof we need to think up a question we can answer in two ways: one way needs to give the left-hand-side of the identity, the other way needs to be the right-hand-side of the identity. Our clue to what question to ask comes from the right-hand side: counts the number of ways to select 3 things from a group of things. Let's name those things . In other words, we want to find 3-element subsets of those numbers (since order should not matter, subsets are exactly the right thing to think about). We will have to be a bit clever to explain why the left-hand-side also gives the number of these subsets. Here's the proof.   Consider the question How many 3-element subsets are there of the set ? We answer this in two ways:  Answer 1: We must select 3 elements from the collection of elements. This can be done in ways.  Answer 2: Break this problem up into cases by what the middle number in the subset is. Say each subset is written in increasing order. We count the number of subsets for each distinct value of . The smallest possible value of is , and the largest is .  When , there are subsets: 1 choice for and choices (3 through ) for .  When , there are subsets: 2 choices for and choices for .

The second proof is a little slicker, using lattice paths.   Consider the question: How many pizzas can you make using toppings when there are toppings to choose from?   Answer 1: There are toppings, from which you must choose . This can be done in ways.  Answer 2: Divide the toppings into two groups of toppings (perhaps meats and veggies). Any choice of toppings must include some number from the first group and some number from the second group. Consider each possible number of meat toppings separately:  0 meats: , since you need to choose 0 of the meats and of the veggies.  1 meat: , since you need 1 of meats so of veggies.  2 meats: . Choose 2 meats and the remaining toppings from the veggies.  And so on. The last case is meats, which can be done in ways.  Thus the total number of pizzas possible is .

Since these two answers are answers to the same question, they must be equal, and thus .   For an alternative proof, we use lattice paths. This is reasonable to consider because the right-hand side of the identity reminds us of the number of paths from to .   Consider the question: How many lattice paths are there from to ?  Answer 1: We must travel steps, and of them must be in the up direction. Thus there are paths.  Answer 2: Note that any path from to must cross the line . That is, any path must pass through exactly one of the points: , , , , . For example, this is what happens in the case :     A light gray grid with points (0,0) and (4,4) identified in the lower left and upper right corners respectively. The line x + y = 4 is shown extending from the top left to bottom right corner. The line intersects the labeled points (0,4), (1,3), (2,2), (3,1), and (4,0).    How many paths pass through ? To get to that point, you must travel units, and of them are to the right, so there are ways to get to . From to takes steps, and of them are up. So there are ways to get from to . Therefore there are paths from to through the point .  What about through . There are paths to get there ( steps, 1 to the right) and paths to complete the journey to ( steps, up). So there are paths from to through .  In general, to get to through the point we have paths to the midpoint and then paths from the midpoint to . So there are paths from to through .

Now answer the counting question again, this time starting by asking how many ways you can select positions for the letter A first. Continue in any way you like until you have found a different expression for the number of ways to permute the letters of STATISTICS as a product of binomial coefficients. Write out this product.       Try yet another approach. What is wrong with saying the answer is This is too large, but we can correct it by dividing to account for outcomes that are equivalent. What should you divide by?  Write your answer as a quotient of factorials. Do you get the same answer as before?          "

How many ways can you distribute the pies?   How many ways are there to distribute the pies without any restriction?    Let's get rid of the ways that one or more kid gets too many pies. How many ways are there to distribute the pies if Al gets too many pies? What if Bruce gets too many? Or Cat? Or Dent?    What if two kids get too many pies? How many ways can this happen? Does it matter which two kids you pick to overfeed?    Is it possible that three kids get too many pies? If so, how many ways can this happen?    How should you combine all the numbers you found above to answer the original question?     Suppose now you have 13 pies and 7 children. No child can have more than 2 pies. How many ways can you distribute the pies?   Stars and sticks allows us to count the number of ways to distribute 10 cookies to 3 kids and natural number solutions to , for example. A relatively easy modification allows us to put a lower bound restriction on these problems: perhaps each kid must get at least two cookies or . This was done by first assigning each kid (or variable) 2 cookies (or units) and then distributing the rest using sticks and stones.    distribution (counting)  with upper bound restriction  What if we wanted an upper bound restriction? For example, we might insist that no kid gets more than 4 cookies or that . It turns out this is considerably harder, but still possible. The idea is to count all the distributions and then remove those that violate the condition. In other words, we must count the number of ways to distribute 11 cookies to 3 kids in which one or more of the kids gets more than 4 cookies. For any particular kid, this is not a problem; we do this using sticks and stones. But how to combine the number of ways for kid A, or B or C? We must use the PIE.  The Principle of Inclusion\/Exclusion (PIE) gives a method for finding the cardinality of the union of not necessarily disjoint sets. We saw in how this works with three sets. To find how many things are in one or more of the sets , , and , we should just add up the number of things in each of these sets. However, if there is any overlap among the sets, those elements are counted multiple times. So we subtract the things in each intersection of a pair of sets. But doing this removes elements which are in all three sets once too often, so we need to add it back in. In terms of cardinality of sets, we have .    Three kids, Alberto, Bernadette, and Carlos, decide to share 11 cookies. They wonder how many ways they could split the cookies up provided that none of them receive more than 4 cookies (someone receiving no cookies is for some reason acceptable to these kids).    Without the no more than 4 restriction, the answer would be , using 11 stones and 2 sticks (separating the three kids). Now count the number of ways that one or more of the kids violates the condition, i.e., gets at least 4 cookies.  Let be the set of outcomes in which Alberto gets more than 4 cookies. Let be the set of outcomes in which Bernadette gets more than 4 cookies. Let be the set of outcomes in which Carlos gets more than 4 cookies. We then are looking (for the sake of subtraction) for the size of the set . Using PIE, we must find the sizes of , , , and so on. Here is what we find.     . First give Alberto 5 cookies, then distribute the remaining 6 to the three kids without restrictions, using 6 stones and 2 sticks.   . Just like above, only now Bernadette gets 5 cookies at the start.   . Carlos gets 5 cookies first.   . Give Alberto and Bernadette 5 cookies each, leaving 1 (stone) to distribute to the three kids (2 sticks).   . Alberto and Carlos get 5 cookies first.   . Bernadette and Carlos get 5 cookies first.   . It is not possible for all three kids to get 4 or more cookies.    Combining all of these we see .  Thus the answer to the original question is . This makes sense now that we see it. The only way to ensure that no kid gets more than 4 cookies is to give two kids 4 cookies and one kid 3; there are three choices for which kid that should be. We could have found the answer much quicker through this observation, but the point of the example is to illustrate that PIE works!      principle of inclusion\/exclusion  for 4 or more sets  For four or more sets, we do not write down a formula for PIE. Instead, we just think of the principle: add up all the elements in single sets, then subtract out things you counted twice (elements in the intersection of a pair of sets), then add back in elements you removed too often (elements in the intersection of groups of three sets), then take back out elements you added back in too often (elements in the intersection of groups of four sets), then add back in, take back out, add back in, etc. This would be very difficult if it wasn't for the fact that in these problems, all the cardinalities of the single sets are equal, as are all the cardinalities of the intersections of two sets, and that of three sets, and so on. Thus we can group all of these together and multiply by how many different combinations of 1, 2, 3, sets there are.    How many ways can you distribute 10 cookies to 4 kids so that no kid gets more than 2 cookies?    There are ways to distribute 10 cookies to 4 kids (using 10 stones and 3 sticks). We will subtract all the outcomes in which a kid gets 3 or more cookies. How many outcomes are there like that? We can force kid A to eat 3 or more cookies by giving him 3 cookies before we start. Doing so reduces the problem to one in which we have 7 cookies to give to 4 kids without any restrictions. In that case, we have 7 stones (the 7 remaining cookies) and 3 sticks (one less than the number of kids) so we can distribute the cookies in ways. Of course we could choose any one of the 4 kids to give too many cookies, so it would appear that there are ways to distribute the cookies giving too many to one kid. But in fact, we have over counted.  We must get rid of the outcomes in which two kids have too many cookies. There are ways to select 2 kids to give extra cookies. It takes 6 cookies to do this, leaving only 4 cookies. So we have 4 stones and still 3 sticks. The remaining 4 cookies can thus be distributed in ways (for each of the choices of which 2 kids to over-feed).  But now we have removed too much. We must add back in all the ways to give too many cookies to three kids. This uses 9 cookies, leaving only 1 to distribute to the 4 kids using sticks and stones, which can be done in ways. We must consider this outcome for every possible choice of which three kids we over-feed, and there are ways of selecting that set of 3 kids.  Next we would subtract all the ways to give four kids too many cookies, but in this case, that number is 0.  All together we get that the number of ways to distribute 10 cookies to 4 kids without giving any kid more than 2 cookies is: which is .  This makes sense: there is NO way to distribute 10 cookies to 4 kids and make sure that nobody gets more than 2. It is slightly surprising that , but since PIE works, this equality must hold.    Just so you don't think that these problems always have easier solutions, consider the following example.    Earlier ( ) we counted the number of solutions to the equation , where for each .  How many of those solutions have for each ?    We must subtract off the number of solutions in which one or more of the variables has a value greater than 3. We will need to use PIE because counting the number of solutions for which each of the five variables separately are greater than 3 counts solutions multiple times. Here is what we get:     Total solutions: .    Solutions where : . Give 4 units first, then distribute the remaining 9 units to the 5 variables.    Solutions where and : . After you give 4 units to and another 4 to , you only have 5 units left to distribute.    Solutions where , and : .    Solutions where , , , and : 0.     We also need to account for the fact that we could choose any of the five variables in the place of above (so there will be outcomes like this), any pair of variables in the place of and ( outcomes) and so on. It is because of this that the double counting occurs, so we need to use PIE. All together we have that the number of solutions with is .      Counting Derangements   For your senior prank, you decide to switch the nameplates on your favorite 5 professors' doors. So that none of them feel left out, you want to make sure that all of the nameplates end up on the wrong door. How many ways can this be accomplished?   The advanced use of PIE has applications beyond sticks and stones. A derangement   derangement  of elements is a permutation in which no element is fixed. For example, there are permutations of the three elements : . but most of these have one or more elements fixed: has all three elements fixed since all three elements are in their original positions, has the first element fixed (1 is in its original first position), and so on. In fact, the only derangements of three elements are .  If we go up to 4 elements, there are 24 permutations (because we have 4 choices for the first element, 3 choices for the second, 2 choices for the third leaving only 1 choice for the last). How many of these are derangements? If you list out all 24 permutations and eliminate those which are not derangements, you will be left with just 9 derangements. Let's see how we can get that number using PIE.    How many derangements are there of 4 elements?    We count all permutations, and subtract those which are not derangements. There are permutations of 4 elements. Now for a permutation to not be a derangement, at least one of the 4 elements must be fixed. There are choices for which single element we fix. Once fixed, we need to find a permutation of the other three elements. There are permutations on 3 elements.  But now we have counted too many non-derangements, so we must subtract those permutations which fix two elements. There are choices for which two elements we fix, and then for each pair, permutations of the remaining elements. But this subtracts too many, so add back in permutations which fix 3 elements, all of them. Finally subtract the permutations (recall ) which fix all four elements. All together we get that the number of derangements of 4 elements is: .    Of course we can use a similar formula to count the derangements of any number of elements. However, the more elements we have, the longer the formula gets. Here is another example:   hat check problem   Five gentlemen attend a party, leaving their hats at the door. At the end of the party, they hastily grab hats on their way out. How many different ways could this happen so that none of the gentlemen leave with his own hat?    We are counting derangements on 5 elements. There are ways for the gentlemen to grab hats in any order but many of these permutations will result in someone getting their own hat. So we subtract all the ways in which one or more of the men get their own hat. In other words, we subtract the non-derangements. Doing so requires PIE. Thus the answer is: .       Counting Functions   function  counting       Consider all functions . How many functions are there all together? How many of those are injective? Remember, a function is an injection if every input goes to a different output.    Consider all functions . How many of the injections have the property that for any ? injection   Your friend claims that the answer is: .  Explain why this is correct.    Recall that a surjection  surjection is a function for which every element of the codomain is in the range. How many of the functions are surjective? Use PIE!      We have seen throughout this chapter that many counting questions can be rephrased as questions about counting functions with certain properties. This is reasonable since many counting questions can be thought of as counting the number of ways to assign elements from one set to elements of another.    You decide to give away your video game collection so as to better spend your time studying advanced mathematics. How many ways can you do this, provided:  You want to distribute your 3 different PS4 games among 5 friends, so that no friend gets more than one game?  You want to distribute your 8 different 3DS games among 5 friends?  You want to distribute your 8 different SNES games among 5 friends, so that each friend gets at least one game?  In each case, model the counting question as a function counting question.       We must use the three games (call them 1, 2, 3) as the domain and the 5 friends (a,b,c,d,e) as the codomain (otherwise the function would not be defined for the whole domain when a friend didn't get any game). So how many functions are there with domain and codomain ? The answer to this is , since we can assign any of 5 elements to be the image of 1, any of 5 elements to be the image of 2 and any of 5 elements to be the image of 3.  But this is not the correct answer to our counting problem, because one of these functions is ; one friend can get more than one game. What we really need to do is count injective functions. This gives functions, which is the answer to our counting question.    Again, we need to use the 8 games as the domain and the 5 friends as the codomain. We are counting all functions, so the number of ways to distribute the games is .    This question is harder. Use the games as the domain and friends as the codomain (the reverse would not give a function). To ensure that every friend gets at least one game means that every element of the codomain is in the range. In other words, we are looking for surjective functions. How do you count those?       In we saw how to count all functions (using the multiplicative principle) and in we learned how to count injective functions (using permutations). Surjective functions are not as easily counted (unless the size of the domain is smaller than the codomain, in which case there are none).  The idea is to count the functions which are not surjective, and then subtract that from the total number of functions. This works very well when the codomain has two elements in it:    surjection  counting    How many functions are surjective?    There are functions all together, two choices for where to send each of the 5 elements of the domain. Now of these, the functions which are not surjective must exclude one or more elements of the codomain from the range. So first, consider functions for which is not in the range. This can only happen one way: everything gets sent to . Alternatively, we could exclude from the range. Then everything gets sent to , so there is only one function like this. These are the only ways in which a function could not be surjective (no function excludes both and from the range) so there are exactly surjective functions.    When there are three elements in the codomain, there are now three choices for a single element to exclude from the range. Additionally, we could pick pairs of two elements to exclude from the range, and we must make sure we don't over count these. It's PIE time!    surjection  counting    How many functions are surjective?    Again start with the total number of functions: (as each of the five elements of the domain can go to any of three elements of the codomain). Now we count the functions which are not surjective.  Start by excluding from the range. Then we have two choices ( or ) for where to send each of the five elements of the domain. Thus there are functions which exclude from the range. Similarly, there are functions which exclude , and another which exclude . Now have we counted all functions which are not surjective? Yes, but in fact, we have counted some multiple times. For example, the function which sends everything to was one of the functions we counted when we excluded from the range, and also one of the functions we counted when we excluded from the range. We must subtract out all the functions which specifically exclude two elements from the range. There is 1 function when we exclude and (everything goes to ), one function when we exclude and , and one function when we exclude and .  We are using PIE: to count the functions which are not surjective, we added up the functions which exclude , , and separately, then subtracted the functions which exclude pairs of elements. We would then add back in the functions which exclude groups of three elements, except that there are no such functions. We find that the number of functions which are not surjective is .  Perhaps a more descriptive way to write this is . since each of the 's was the result of choosing 1 of the 3 elements of the codomain to exclude from the range, each of the three 's was the result of choosing 2 of the 3 elements of the codomain to exclude. Writing instead of 1 makes sense too: we have 1 choice of where to send each of the 5 elements of the domain.  Now we can finally count the number of surjective functions: .    You might worry that to count surjective functions when the codomain is larger than 3 elements would be too tedious. We need to use PIE but with more than 3 sets the formula for PIE is very long. However, we have lucked out. As we saw in the example above, the number of functions which exclude a single element from the range is the same no matter which single element is excluded. Similarly, the number of functions which exclude a pair of elements will be the same for every pair. With larger codomains, we will see the same behavior with groups of 3, 4, and more elements excluded. So instead of adding\/subtracting each of these, we can simply add or subtract all of them at once, if you know how many there are. This works just like it did in for the other types of counting questions in this section, only now the size of the various combinations of sets is a number raised to a power, as opposed to a binomial coefficient or factorial. Here's what happens with and elements in the codomain.    surjection  counting       How many functions are surjective?    How many functions are surjective?          There are functions all together; we will subtract the functions which are not surjective. We could exclude any one of the four elements of the codomain, and doing so will leave us with functions for each excluded element. This counts too many so we subtract the functions which exclude two of the four elements of the codomain, each pair giving functions. But this excludes too many, so we add back in the functions which exclude three of the four elements of the codomain, each triple giving function. There are groups of functions excluding a single element, groups of functions excluding a pair of elements, and groups of functions excluding a triple of elements. This means that the number of functions which are not surjective is: . We can now say that the number of functions which are surjective is: .    The number of surjective functions is: . We took the total number of functions and subtracted all that were not surjective. There were ways to select a single element from the codomain to exclude from the range, and for each there were functions. But this double counts, so we use PIE and subtract functions excluding two elements from the range: there are choices for the two elements to exclude, and for each pair, functions. This takes out too many functions, so we add back in functions which exclude 3 elements from the range: choices for which three to exclude, and then functions for each choice of elements. Finally we take back out the 1 function which excludes 4 elements for each of the choices of 4 elements.  If you happen to calculate this number precisely, you will get 120 surjections. That happens to also be the value of . This might seem like an amazing coincidence until you realize that every surjective function with finite must necessarily be a bijection. The number of bijections is always in this case. What we have here is a combinatorial proof of the following identity: .         function  counting  We have seen that counting surjective functions is another nice example of the advanced use of the Principle of Inclusion\/Exclusion. Also, counting injective functions turns out to be equivalent to permutations, and counting all functions has a solution akin to those counting problems where order matters but repeats are allowed (like counting the number of words you can make from a given set of letters).  These are not just a few more examples of the techniques we have developed in this chapter. Quite the opposite: everything we have learned in this chapter are examples of counting functions !    How many 5-letter words can you make using the eight letters through ? How many contain no repeated letters?    By now it should be no surprise that there are words, and words without repeated letters. The new piece here is that we are actually counting functions. For the first problem, we are counting all functions from to . The numbers in the domain represent the position of the letter in the word, the codomain represents the letter that could be assigned to that position. If we ask for no repeated letters, we are asking for injective functions.  If and are any sets with and , then the number of functions is and the number of injections is . So if you can represent your counting problem as a function counting problem, most of the work is done.      How many subsets are there of ? How many 9-bit strings are there (of any weight)?    We saw in that the answer to both these questions is , as we can say yes or no (or 0 or 1) to each of the 9 elements in the set (positions in the bit-string). But also looks like the answer you get from counting functions. In fact, if you count all functions with and , this is exactly what you get.  This makes sense! Let and . We are assigning each element of the set either a yes or a no. Or in the language of bit-strings, we would take the 9 positions in the bit string as our domain and the set as the codomain.      function  counting    injection  counting   binomial coefficient   combination  vs permutation    permutation  vs combination  So far we have not used a function as a model for binomial coefficients (combinations). Think for a moment about the relationship between combinations and permutations, say specifically and . We do have a function model for . This is the number of injective functions from a set of size 3 (say to a set of size 9 (say ) since there are 9 choices for where to send the first element of the domain, then only 8 choices for the second, and 7 choices for the third. For example, the function might look like this: .  This is a different function from: .  Now counts these as different outcomes correctly, but will count these (among others) as just one outcome. In fact, in terms of functions just counts the number of different ranges possible of injective functions. This should not be a surprise since binomial coefficients counts subsets, and the range is a possible subset of the codomain. A more mathematically sophisticated interpretation of combinations is that we are defining two injective functions to be equivalent if they have the same range, and then counting the number of equivalence classes under this notion of equivalence.  While it is possible to interpret combinations as functions, perhaps the better advice is to instead use combinations (or sticks and stones) when functions are not quite the right way to interpret the counting question.      The dollar menu at your favorite tax-free fast food restaurant has 9 items. You have $20 to spend. How many different meals can you buy if you spend all your money and:   Purchase at least one of each item.    Possibly skip some items.

Here you have 20 stars and 8 bars (separating the 9 items). a. meals. Use PIE to subtract all the meals in which you get 3 or more of a particular item.           After a late night of math studying, you and your friends decide to go to your favorite tax-free fast food Mexican restaurant, Burrito Chime . You decide to order off of the dollar menu, which has 7 items. Your group has $9 to spend (and will spend all of it).   How many different orders are possible? (The order in which the order is placed does not matter - just which and how many of each item that is ordered.)    How many different orders are possible if you want to get at least one of each item?    How many different orders are possible if you don t get more than 4 of any one item?                      - there are 9 stars and 6 bars.    - buy one of each item, using $7. This leaves you $2 to distribute to the 7 items, so 2 stars and 6 bars.    meals. Use PIE to subtract all the meals in which you get 5 or more of a particular item.           After another gym class you are tasked with putting the 14 identical dodgeballs away into 5 bins. This time, no bin can hold more than 6 balls. How many ways can you clean up?                Consider the equation How many solutions are there with for all ;        The easiest way to solve this is to first distribute the minimum amount of units to each variable (3) and then count the solutions to with By taking each solution to this new equation corresponds to exactly one solution to the original equation.  Now all the ways to distribute the 10 units to the four variables can be found using stars and bars, specifically 10 stars and 3 bars, so ways. But this includes the ways that one or more variables can be assigned more than 3 units. So subtract using PIE to get   The counts the number of ways to pick one variable to be over-assigned, the is the number of ways to assign the remaining units to the 4 variables, etc.         Suppose you planned on giving 8 gold stars to some of the 16 star students in your class. Each student can receive at most one star. How many ways can you do this?   Use Pascal s triangle to find the numeric answer.      Use the Principle of Inclusion and Exclusion.                 This makes sense because if each student can receive at most one star, you must pick which 8 of the 16 kids will get one.    Without any restriction, there would be ways to distribute the stars. Now we must use PIE to eliminate all distributions in which one or more student gets more than one star:             Based on the previous question, give a combinatorial proof for the identity: .    Illustrate how the counting of derangements works by writing all permutations of and the crossing out those which are not derangements. Keep track of the permutations you cross out more than once, using PIE.   The 9 derangements are: 2143, 2341, 2413, 3142, 3412, 3421, 4123, 4312, 4321.     How many permutations of leave exactly 1 element fixed?        First pick one of the 6 elements to be fixed. For each such choice, derange the remaining 5, using the standard advanced PIE formula. We get permutations.         13 ladies of a certain age drop off their red hats at the hat check of a museum. As they are leaving, the hat check attendant gives the hats back randomly. In how many ways can exactly 9 of the ladies receive their own hat (and the other 4 not)?        ways. We choose 9 of the 13 ladies to get their own hat, and then multiply by the number of ways the remaining hats can be deranged.         The Grinch sneaks into a room with 10 Christmas presents to 10 different people. He proceeds to switch the name-labels on the presents. How many ways could he do this if:   No present is allowed to end up with its original label? Explain what each term in your answer represents.    Exactly 5 presents keep their original labels? Explain.    Exactly 9 presents keep their original labels? Explain.                                  0. Once 9 presents have their original label, there is only one present left and only one label left, so the 10th present must get its own label.           Consider functions How many functions have the property that or or both?

Let be the set of outcomes in which Bernadette gets more than 4 cookies. Let be the set of outcomes in which Carlos gets more than 4 cookies. We then are looking (for the sake of subtraction) for the size of the set . Using PIE, we must find the sizes of , , , and so on. Here is what we find.     . First give Alberto 5 cookies, then distribute the remaining 6 to the three kids without restrictions, using 6 stones and 2 sticks.   . Just like above, only now Bernadette gets 5 cookies at the start.   . Carlos gets 5 cookies first.   . Give Alberto and Bernadette 5 cookies each, leaving 1 (stone) to distribute to the three kids (2 sticks).   . Alberto and Carlos get 5 cookies first.   . Bernadette and Carlos get 5 cookies first.   . It is not possible for all three kids to get 4 or more cookies.    Combining all of these we see .  Thus the answer to the original question is . This makes sense now that we see it. The only way to ensure that no kid gets more than 4 cookies is to give two kids 4 cookies and one kid 3; there are three choices for which kid that should be. We could have found the answer much quicker through this observation, but the point of the example is to illustrate that PIE works!   "

We will subtract all the outcomes in which a kid gets 3 or more cookies. How many outcomes are there like that? We can force kid A to eat 3 or more cookies by giving him 3 cookies before we start. Doing so reduces the problem to one in which we have 7 cookies to give to 4 kids without any restrictions. In that case, we have 7 stones (the 7 remaining cookies) and 3 sticks (one less than the number of kids) so we can distribute the cookies in ways. Of course we could choose any one of the 4 kids to give too many cookies, so it would appear that there are ways to distribute the cookies giving too many to one kid. But in fact, we have over counted.  We must get rid of the outcomes in which two kids have too many cookies. There are ways to select 2 kids to give extra cookies. It takes 6 cookies to do this, leaving only 4 cookies. So we have 4 stones and still 3 sticks. The remaining 4 cookies can thus be distributed in ways (for each of the choices of which 2 kids to over-feed).  But now we have removed too much. We must add back in all the ways to give too many cookies to three kids. This uses 9 cookies, leaving only 1 to distribute to the 4 kids using sticks and stones, which can be done in ways. We must consider this outcome for every possible choice of which three kids we over-feed, and there are ways of selecting that set of 3 kids.  Next we would subtract all the ways to give four kids too many cookies, but in this case, that number is 0.  All together we get that the number of ways to distribute 10 cookies to 4 kids without giving any kid more than 2 cookies is: which is .  This makes sense: there is NO way to distribute 10 cookies to 4 kids and make sure that nobody gets more than 2. It is slightly surprising that , but since PIE works, this equality must hold.   "

With all the different counting techniques we have mastered in this last chapter, it might be difficult to know when to apply which technique. Indeed, it is very easy to get mixed up and use the wrong counting method for a given problem. You get better with practice. As you practice you start to notice some trends that can help you distinguish between types of counting problems. Here are some suggestions that you might find helpful when deciding how to tackle a counting problem and checking whether your solution is correct.     Remember that you are counting the number of items in some list of outcomes . Write down part of this list. Write down an element in the middle of the list how are you deciding whether your element really is in the list. Could you get this element more than once using your proposed answer?    If generating an element on the list involves selecting something (for example, picking a letter or picking a position to put a letter, etc), can the things you select be repeated? Remember, permutations and combinations select objects from a set without repeats.    Does order matter? Be careful here and be sure you know what your answer really means. We usually say that order matters when you get different outcomes when the same objects are selected in different orders. Combinations and Stars & Bars are used when order does not matter.     combination vs permutation  permutation vs combination  stars and bars vs combination There are four possibilities when it comes to order and repeats. If order matters and repeats are allowed, the answer will look like . If order matters and repeats are not allowed, we have . If order doesn't matter and repeats are allowed, use stars and bars. If order doesn't matter and repeats are not allowed, use . But be careful: this only applies when you are selecting things, and you should make sure you know exactly what you are selecting before determining which case you are in.    Think about how you would represent your counting problem in terms of sets or functions. We know how to count different sorts of sets and different types of functions.    As we saw with combinatorial proofs, you can often solve a counting problem in more than one way. Do that, and compare your numerical answers. If they don't match, something is amiss.     While we have covered many counting techniques, we have really only scratched the surface of the large subject of enumerative combinatorics . There are mathematicians doing original research in this area even as you read this. Counting can be really hard.  In the next chapter, we will approach counting questions from a very different direction, and in doing so, answer infinitely many counting questions at the same time. We will create sequences of answers to related questions.    Chapter Review    You have 15 presents to give to your 5 kids. How many ways can this be done if:   The presents are identical, and each kid gets at least one present?    The presents are identical, and some kids might get no presents?    The presents are unique, and some kids might get no presents?    The presents are unique and each kid gets at least one present?                           ways, after giving one present to each kid, you are left with 10 presents (stars) which need to be divide among the 5 kids (giving 4 bars).    ways. You have 15 stars and 4 bars.    You have 5 choices for whom to give each present. This is like making a function from the set of presents to the set of kids.    ways. Now the function from the set of presents to the set of kids must be surjective.           bow ties  combination vs permutation  permutation vs combination  For each of the following counting problems, say whether the answer is , , or neither. If you answer is neither, say what the answer should be instead.   How many shortest lattice paths are there from to ?    If you have 10 bow ties, and you want to select 4 of them for next week, how many choices do you have?    Suppose you have 10 bow ties and you will wear a different one on each of the next 4 days. How many choices do you have?    If you want to wear 4 of your 10 bow ties next week (Monday through Sunday), how many ways can this be accomplished?

It will be a complicated (possibly PIE) counting problem.        Recall, you own 7 regular ties and 4 bow ties. You realize that it would be okay to wear more than two ties to your clown college interview.   You must select some of your ties to wear. Everything is okay, from no ties up to all ties. How many choices do you have?    If you want to wear at least one regular tie and one bow tie, but are willing to wear up to all your ties, how many choices do you have for which ties to wear?    How many choices of which ties to wear do you have if you wear exactly 3 of the 7 regular ties and 2 of the 4 bow ties?    Once you have selected 3 regular and 2 bow ties, in how many orders could you put the ties on, assuming you must have one of the bow ties on top?                           choices. You have two choices for each tie: wear it or don t.    You have 127 choices for regular ties (the choices less the no regular tie option) and 15 choices for bow ties ( total minus the no bow tie option). Thus total you have choices.    choices.    Select one of the 2 bow ties to go on top. There are then 4 choices for the next tie, 4-1 for the tie after that, and so on. Thus choices.          Give a counting question where the answer is . Give another question where the answer is .   bow ties  You own 8 purple bow ties, 3 red bow ties, 3 blue bow ties and 5 green bow ties. How many ways can you select one of each color bow tie to take with you on a trip? ways. How many choices do you have for a single bow tie to wear tomorrow? choices.     Consider numbers of the form with digits, each digit from the set For example, if , the number will have 4 digits from the set  Let .    How many such numbers are there?    How many such numbers are there for which the sum of the digits is even?    How many such numbers contain more even digits than odd digits?                      numbers.    numbers (choose any digits for the first 14 digits - then pick either an even or an odd last digit to make the sum even).    We need 8 or more even digits. 8 even digits: 8+1 even digits: etc. By adding these together, we get the total number of ways to have 8 or more even digits.           In a recent small survey of airline passengers, 29 said they had flown American in the last year, 24 had flown Jet Blue, and 30 had flown Continental. Of those, 18 reported they had flown on American and Jet Blue, 10 had flown on Jet Blue and Continental, and 14 had flown on American and Continental. 7 passengers had flown on all three airlines.  How many passengers were surveyed? (Assume the results above make up the entire survey.)        48 passengers. We are asking for the size of the union of three non-disjoint sets. Using PIE, we have         Recall, by -bit strings, we mean strings of binary digits, of length 12.   How many -bit strings are there total?    How many -bit strings have weight 8?    How many subsets of the set {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12} contain exactly 8 elements?                      strings.    strings.    strings.           What is the coefficient of in the expansion of                How many 12-letter words contain exactly 4 vowels? (For example, an 8-letter word with 5 vowels is aaioobtt ; don t consider y a vowel for this exercise.)  What if repeated letters were not allowed?             With repeated letters allowed, we select which 4 of the 12 letters will be vowels, then pick one of the 5 vowels for each spot, and finally pick one of the other 21 letters for each of the remaining 8 spots. Thus, words.  Without repeats, we still pick the positions of the vowels, but now each time we place a vowel there, we have one fewer choice for the next one. Similarly, we cannot repeat the consonants. We get words.         For each of the following, find the number of shortest lattice paths from to which:   pass through the point    avoid (do not pass through) the point    either pass through or (or both).                      paths.    paths.    paths.           You live in Grid-Town on the corner of 2nd and 4th, and work in a building on the corner of 9th and 10th. How many routes are there which take you from home to work and then back home, but by a different route?        routes. For each of the routes to work there is exactly one less route back.         How many 6-bit strings start with or end with or both?        strings (using PIE).         How many 11-bit strings of weight 7 start with or end with or both?        strings.         We are making 7-letter words from the set of letters , in such a way that we have exactly the first 7 letters available so that we use all letters.   How many 7-letter words can we make from the letters without repeats that do not contain the sub-word bad in consecutive letters?      How many words don t contain the subword bad in not-necessarily-consecutive letters (but in order)?               There are 5 spots to start the word, and then there are ways to arrange the other letters in the remaining three spots. Thus the number of words avoiding the sub-word bad in consecutive letters is  If we now need to avoid words that put b before a before d , we must choose which spots those letters go (in that order) and then arrange the remaining 4 letters. Thus, words.        Explain using lattice paths why .    is the number of lattice paths which have length , since for each step you can go up or right. Such a path would end along the line . So you will end at , or or or or . Counting the paths to each of these points separately, give , , , , (each time choosing which of the steps to be to the right). These two methods count the same quantity, so are equal.     Suppose you have 22 one-dollar bills to give out as prizes to your top 7 discrete math students. How many ways can you do this if:   Each of the 7 students gets at least 1 dollar?    Some students might get nothing?    Each student gets at least 1 dollar but no more than 7 dollars?     Use stars and bars.                    ways.    ways.    ways.           How many functions are there satisfying:   or (or both)?    or (or both)?     and  and is injective?    is surjective, but                           functions.    functions.    functions. Note we use factorials instead of powers because we are looking for injective functions.    Note that being surjective here is the same as being injective, so we can start with all injective functions and subtract those which have one or more fixed point . We get functions.           How many functions map  onto  (i.e., how many surjections are there)?                To thank your math professor for doing such an amazing job all semester, you decide to bake your professor cookies. You know how to make 16 different types of cookies.   If you want to give your professor 6 different types of cookies, how many different combinations of cookie type can you select? Explain your answer.    To keep things interesting, you decide to make a different number of each type of cookie. If again you want to select 6 cookie types, how many ways can you select the cookie types and decide for which there will be the most, second most, etc. Explain your answer.    You change your mind again. This time you decide you will make a total of 22 cookies. Each cookie could be any one of the 16 types of cookies you know how to bake (and it s okay if you leave some types out). How many choices do you have? Explain.    You realize that the previous plan did not account for presentation. This time, you once again want to make 22 cookies, each one could be any one of the 16 types of cookies. However, now you plan to shape the cookies into the numerals 1, 2, ..., 22. How many choices do you have for which types of cookies to bake into which numerals? Explain.    The only flaw with the last plan is that your professor might not get to sample all 16 different varieties of cookies. How many choices do you have for which types of cookies to make into which numerals, given that each type of cookie should be present at least once? Explain.                                combinations. You need to choose 6 of the 16 cookie types. Order doesn t matter.    ways. You are choosing and arranging 6 out of 16 cookies. Order matters now.    choices. You must switch between cookie type 15 times as you make your 22 cookies. The cookies are the stars, the switches between cookie types are the bars.    choices. You have 16 choices for the 1 cookie, 16 choices for the 2 cookie, and so on.    choices. We must use PIE to remove all the ways in which one or more cookie type is not selected.          For which of the parts of the previous problem ( ) does it make sense to interpret the counting question as counting some number of functions? Say what the domain and codomain should be, and whether you are counting all functions, injections, surjections, or something else.      You are giving your professor 4 types of cookies coming from 10 different types of cookies. This does not lend itself well to a function interpretation. We could say that the domain contains the 4 types you will give your professor and the codomain contains the 10 you can choose from, but then counting injections would be too much (it doesn't matter if you pick type 3 first and type 2 second, or the other way around, just that you pick those two types).    We want to consider injective functions from the set most, second most, second least, least to the set of 10 cookie types. We want injections because we cannot pick the same type of cookie to give most and least of (for example).    This is not a good problem to interpret as a function. The problem is that the domain would have to be the 12 cookies you bake, but these elements are indistinguishable (there is not a first cookie, second cookie, etc.).    The domain should be the 12 shapes, the codomain the 10 types of cookies. Since we can use the same type for different shapes, we are interested in counting all functions here.    Here we insist that each type of cookie be given at least once, so now we are asking for the number of surjections of those functions counted in the previous part.       "

  "body": " Describing Sequences   domino  You have a large collection of squares and dominoes. You want to arrange these to make a strip. How many ways can you do this?   Start by collecting data. How many length strips can you make? How many strips? How many strips? And so on.    How are the and strips related to the strips?    How many strips can you make?    What if I asked you to find the number of strips? Would the method you used to calculate the number of strips be helpful?      A sequence   sequence  is simply an ordered list of numbers. For example, here is a sequence: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, . This is different from the set because, while the sequence is a complete list of every element in the set of natural numbers, in the sequence we very much care what order the numbers come in. For this reason, when we use variables to represent terms in a sequence they will look like this: . To refer to the entire sequence at once, we will write or , or sometimes if we are being sloppy, just (in which case we assume we start the sequence with ).  sequence  notation for       the sequence    We might replace the with another letter, and sometimes we omit , starting with , in which case we would use to refer to the sequence as a whole. The numbers in the subscripts are called indices (the plural of index ).    sequence  as function  While we often just think of a sequence as an ordered list of numbers, it is really a type of function. Specifically, the sequence is a function with domain where is the image of the natural number . Later we will manipulate sequences in much the same way you have manipulated functions in algebra or calculus. We can shift a sequence up or down, add two sequences, or ask for the rate of change of a sequence. These are done exactly as you would for functions.  That said, while keeping the rigorous mathematical definition in mind is helpful, we often describe sequences by writing out the first few terms.    Can you find the next term in the following sequences?                                      No you cannot. You might guess that the next terms are:              64    49    34    28    17           In fact, those are the next terms of the sequences I had in mind when I made up the example, but there is no way to be sure they are correct.  Still, we will often do this. Given the first few terms of a sequence, we can ask what the pattern in the sequence suggests the next terms are.    Given that no number of initial terms in a sequence is enough to say for certain which sequence we are dealing with, we need to find another way to specify a sequence. We consider two ways to do this:   Closed formula  A closed formula   closed formula    sequence  closed formula for  for a sequence is a formula for using a fixed finite number of operations on . This is what you normally think of as a formula in , just as if you were defining a function in terms of (because that is exactly what you are doing).    Recursive definition  A recursive definition   recursive definition    sequence  recursive definition for    sequence  inductive definition for  (sometimes called an inductive definition ) for a sequence consists of a recurrence relation   recurrence relation  : an equation relating a term of the sequence to previous terms (terms with smaller index) and an initial condition :  initial condition  a list of a few terms of the sequence (one less than the number of terms in the recurrence relation).   It is easier to understand what is going on here with an example:    Here are a few closed formulas for sequences:  sequence  closed formula for    .  .   .    Note in each formula, if you are given , you can calculate directly: just plug in . For example, to find in the second sequence, just compute .  Here are a few recursive definitions for sequences:  sequence  recursive definition for    with .  with .   with and .    In these formulas, if you are given , you cannot calculate directly, you first need to find (or and ). In the second sequence, to find you would take , but to find we would need to know . We do know this, so we could trace back through these equations to find , and finally .  Fibonacci sequence      You might wonder why we would bother with recursive definitions for sequences. After all, it is harder to find with a recursive definition than with a closed formula. This is true, but it is also harder to find a closed formula for a sequence than it is to find a recursive definition. So to find a useful closed formula, we might first find the recursive definition, then use that to find the closed formula.  This is not to say that recursive definitions aren't useful in finding . You can always calculate given a recursive definition, it might just take a while.    Find in the sequence defined by with and .    We know that . So to find we need to find and . Well , so if we can only find and we would be set. Of course , so we only need to find and . But we are given these. Thus .  Note that now we can guess a closed formula for the th term of the sequence: . To be sure this will always work, we could plug in this formula into the recurrence relation: .  That is not quite enough though, since there can be multiple closed formulas that satisfy the same recurrence relation; we must also check that our closed formula agrees on the initial terms of the sequence. Since and are the correct initial conditions, we can now conclude we have the correct closed formula.    Finding closed formulas, or even recursive definitions, for sequences is not trivial. There is no one method for doing this. Just as in evaluating integrals or solving differential equations, it is useful to have a bag of tricks you can apply, but sometimes there is no easy answer.  One useful method is to relate a given sequence to another sequence for which we already know the closed formula. To do this, we need a few known sequences to compare mystery sequences to. Here are a few that are good to know. We will verify the formulas for these in the coming sections.   Common Sequences   triangular numbers    square numbers    powers of 2    Fibonacci sequence         The square numbers . The sequence has closed formula       The triangular numbers . The sequence has closed formula .      the th triangular number        The powers of 2 . The sequence with closed formula .       The Fibonacci numbers (or Fibonacci sequence), defined recursively by with .        Use the formulas and to find closed formulas that agree with the following sequences. Assume each first term corresponds to .    : .     : .     : .     : .     : .      .     : .     : .         triangular numbers    powers of 2  We wish to compare these sequences to the triangular numbers , when we start with , and the powers of 2: .    . Note that if subtract 1 from each term, we get the sequence . So we have . Therefore a closed formula is . A quick check of the first few confirms we have it right.     . Each term in this sequence is one more than a power of 2, so we might guess the closed formula is . If we try this though, we get and . We are off because the indices are shifted. What we really want is giving .    ( ). Notice that all these terms are even. What happens if we factor out a 2? We get ! More precisely, we find that , so this sequence has closed formula .     . These are all triangular numbers. However, we are starting with 3 as our initial term instead of as our third term. So if we could plug in 2 instead of 0 into the formula for , we would be set. Therefore the closed formula is (where came from ). Thinking about sequences as functions, we are doing a horizontal shift by 2: which would cause the graph to shift 2 units to the left.     . Try adding 1 to each term and we get powers of 2. You might guess this because each term is a little more than twice the previous term (the powers of 2 are exactly twice the previous term). Closed formula: .     . These numbers are also doubling each time, but are also all multiples of 3. Dividing each by 3 gives 1, 2, 4, 8, . Aha. We get the closed formula .     . To get from one term to the next, we almost double each term. So maybe we can relate this back to . Yes, each term is 2 more than a power of 2. So we get (the is because the first term is 2 more than , not ). Alternatively, we could have related this sequence to the second sequence in this example: starting with 3, 5, 9, 17, we see that this sequence is twice the terms from that sequence. That sequence had closed formula . Our sequence here would be twice this, so , which is the same as we got before.     . Try dividing each term by 3. That gives the sequence . Now add 1 to each term: , which is in this example, except starting with 6 instead of 0. So let's start with the formula . To start with the 6, we shift: . But this is one too many, so subtract 1: . That gives us our sequence, but divided by 3. So we want .        Partial sums  Some sequences naturally arise as the sum of terms of another sequence.    Sam keeps track of how many push-ups she does each day of her do lots of push-ups challenge. Let be the sequence that describes the number of push-ups done on the th day of the challenge. The sequence starts . Describe a sequence that describes the total number of push-ups done by Sam after the th day.    We can find the terms of this sequence easily enough. . Here is just , but then , , and so on.  There are a few ways we might describe in general. We could do so recursively as, , since the total number of push-ups done after days will be the number done after days, plus the number done on day .  For something closer to a closed formula, we could write , or the same thing using summation notation : .  summation notation    Sigma notation  However, note that these are not really closed formulas since even if we had a formula for , we would still have an increasing number of computations to do as increases.    Given any sequence , we can always form a new sequence by . Since the terms of are the sums of the initial part of the sequence ways call the sequence of partial sums of .  sequence of partial sums    partial sums  sequence of partial sums  Soon we will see that it is sometimes possible to find a closed formula for from the closed formula for .  To simplify writing out these sums, we will often use notation like . This means add up the 's where changes from 1 to .  summation notation    Sigma notation      Use notation to rewrite the sums:          .                     If we want to multiply the instead, we could write . For example, .  product notation      Sequences in python  It is easy to check whether a closed formula is correct using a calculator, or better yet, a programming language like python. One way you can do this is to define a function that returns the th term of the sequence.  Here is an example: suppose you wanted to check whether a formula you found for the sequence is correct. Perhaps you guess that . Try running the code below. (Note: in python, the ^ symbol means something else, so to do exponentiation, you would use ** .)   def a(n): return 2**n-1 print(a(3))   Looks promising, but we should be careful: our sequence started with , which makes . Now try modifying the definition of a(n) (by changing the return value) to get the correct closed formula.  Perhaps you want to print out the first 20 terms of the sequence? This is easy to do with python, by putting the terms in a list:   def a(n): return 2**(n+1) - 1 sequence = [] for n in range(20): sequence.append(a(n)) print(sequence)   Note that range(20) starts at 0 and stops at 19 (it is the list [0,1,2,...,19] ).  We can also use python to generate terms for a sequence given a recursive definition. Suppose we wanted to explore the sequence with initial condition . In python, we could generate the sequence as follows.   def a(n): if n == 0: return 1 else: return 2*a(n-1)+1 # just print out the first 10 terms for i in range(10): print(a(i))   Do you see how to translate a recurrence relation into a recursive python function? Try playing around with the code above to explore other sequences.     For the formulas for sequences below, select all that are closed formulas (as opposed to recursive formulas).          Correct. You can compute the value of for any specified directly (in a fixed, finite number of steps).           Correct. Computing can be done directly from the definition, not relying on knowing other terms in the sequence.           This is a recursive formula: to find for example, you need to know .           Can you find just from the number 9? Or do you need to know other terms in the sequence?      Drag each sequence on the left to a recurrence relation that agrees with the sequence.                                      Practice Problems          For the sequence with closed formula find the term   .              Consider the sequence with recurrence relation with initial term Find the term   .

Find a recursive formula for the number of regions created by lines, and justify why your recursion is correct.

For example, , and (since of the 9 ternary strings of length 2, only one is not good).  Find, with justification, a recursive formula for , and use it to compute .   Consider three cases: the last digit is a 0, a 1, or a 2. Two of these should be easy to count, but strings ending in 0 cannot be proceeded by a 2, so require a little more work.   bit string  Consider bit strings with length and weight (so strings of 0's and 1's, including 1's). We know how to count the number of these for a fixed and . Now, we will count the number of strings for which the sum of the length and the weight is fixed. For example, let's count all the bit strings for which .   Find examples of these strings of different lengths. What is the longest string possible? What is the shortest?    How many strings are there of each of these lengths. Use this to count the total number of strings (with sum 11).    The other approach: Let vary. How many strings have sum ? How many have sum ?

Describe the rate of growth of the number of dots in the pattern. Then give guess a recursive definition and a closed formula for the number of dots in the th pattern.      A sequence of three dot patterns, starting with a single dot (labeled n = 0), then the same dot with four new dots extending into an X (labeled n = 1) and finally the same pattern but with four new dots extending onto the limbs of the X (labeled n = 2).       A sequence of three dot patterns, labeled n = 0, n = 1, and n = 2, from left to right. The first pattern contains two dots, on above the other. The second pattern can be viewed as each of the dots from the first pattern splitting into 3, forming two triangles (so six dots total). The third patter again takes each dot from the second pattern and splits them into three, arranged as triangles (so 18 dots all together).       A sequence of four dot patters, labeled n = 1 through n = 4. The first pattern is a single dot. The second adds a row of two dots below the single dot (so three dots in a triangle). The third pattern adds a row of three dots, creating six dots arranged in a triangle. Finally we add four dots below the previous six, still forming a triangle, this time of 10 dots.     Our goal is to find closed formulas for sequences. Our primary strategy will be to first determine how the sequence is changing from term to term. This will lead to a recurrence relation for the sequence, and from that recurrence relation, we will find a closed formula. We start with two types of sequences that are particularly common and useful: arithmetic and geometric sequences.  Suppose you start a business selling prints of mathematical art. In week zero, you sell one print. Each week after that, you sell four more prints than you did the previous week. How many prints will you sell in the th week?  We can easily compute the first few terms of the sequence: . How do I know this is correct? From the problem, we see that to get from one term to the next, we must add 4. I is clear then that the recurrence relation for the sequence is . The rate of growth for the sequence is the constant , since the difference between any two terms is 4 (note, we could write the recurrence relation as ).  We call sequences with a constant rate of change  arithmetic sequences .  Now let's find a closed formula for our sequence. The first term is . To get , we add . The next term requires us to add again, which means we have added to our initial term twice. Then we add again, for a total of three times for . In fact, to get , we will have added to a total of times. Thus, the closed formula for the sequence is .  This works for any arithmetic sequence. That is, any sequence with a constant difference will have a linear closed formula, where the slope of the linear function is the common difference.   Arithmetic Sequences  arithmetic sequence  recursive definition for arithmetic sequence  common difference  closed formula for arithmetic sequence  If the terms of a sequence differ by a constant, we say the sequence is arithmetic . If the initial term ( ) of the sequence is and the common difference is , then we have,  Recursive definition: with .  Closed formula: .   As we did for our example above, for the recursive definition, we need to specify . Then we need to express in terms of . If we call the first term , then . For the recurrence relation, by the definition of an arithmetic sequence, the difference between successive terms is some constant, say . So , or in other words, .  To find a closed formula, first write out the sequence in general:   We see that to find the th term, we need to start with and then add a bunch of times. In fact, add it times. Thus .    Find recursive definitions and closed formulas for the arithmetic sequences below. Assume the first term listed is .    .  .      First we should check that these sequences really are arithmetic by taking differences of successive terms. Doing so will reveal the common difference .     , , etc. To get from each term to the next, we add three, so . The recursive definition is therefore with . The closed formula is .   Here the common difference is , since we add to 50 to get 43, and so on. Thus we have a recursive definition of with . The closed formula is .       What about sequences like ? This is not arithmetic because the difference between terms is not constant. However, the ratio between successive terms is constant. We call such sequences geometric .  The recursive definition for the geometric sequence with initial term and common ratio is . To get the next term we multiply the previous term by .

The common ratio is . So the sequence has recursive definition with and closed formula .       Geometric sequences are those which have a growth rate that is proportional to the sequence itself. Just like you might have seen in Calculus, it is exactly the exponential functions that have this property.  In the examples and formulas above, we assumed that the initial term was . If your sequence starts with , you can easily find the term that would have been and use that in the formula. For example, if we want a formula for the sequence and insist that , then we can find (since the sequence is arithmetic with common difference 3, we have ). Then the closed formula will be .   If you look at other textbooks or online, you might find that their closed formulas for arithmetic and geometric sequences differ from ours. Specifically, you might find the formulas (arithmetic) and (geometric). Which is correct? Both! In our case, we take to be . If instead we had as our initial term, we would get the (slightly more complicated) formulas you find elsewhere.     Arithmetic and Geometric Rates of Change    Your neighborhood grocery store has a candy machine full of Skittles.   Suppose that the candy machine currently holds exactly 650 Skittles, and every time someone inserts a quarter, exactly 7 Skittles come out of the machine.   How many Skittles will be left in the machine after 20 quarters have been inserted?    Will there ever be exactly zero Skittles left in the machine? Explain.       What if the candy machine gives 7 Skittles to the first customer who put in a quarter, 10 to the second, 13 to the third, 16 to the fourth, etc. How many Skittles has the machine given out after 20 quarters are put into the machine?    Now, what if the machine gives 4 Skittles to the first customer, 7 to the second, 12 to the third, 19 to the fourth, etc. How many Skittles has the machine given out after 20 quarters are put into the machine?      Look at the sequence which starts . These are called the triangular numbers  triangular numbers since they represent the number of dots in an equilateral triangle (think of how you arrange 10 bowling pins: a row of 4 plus a row of 3 plus a row of 2 and a row of 1).     A sequence of four dot patters, showing the first four triangular numbers: the patterns contain 1, 3, 6, and 10 dots, arranged in triangles with base 1, 2, 3, and 4, respectively.    Is this sequence arithmetic? No, since and , so there is no common difference. Is the sequence geometric? No. but , so there is no common ratio. What to do?  Notice that the differences between terms do form an arithmetic sequence: . In other words, the rate of change of this sequence is arithmetic: , which immediately gives us the recurrence relation .  Another way to think of this is that the th term of the sequence is the sum of the first terms in the sequence . We say that is the sequence of partial sums  sequence of partial sums for triangular numbers of the sequence ( partial sums because we are not taking the sum of all infinitely many terms).  This should become clearer if we expand the recurrence relation to write the triangular numbers like this: .  If we know how to add up the terms of an arithmetic sequence, we could find a closed formula for a sequence whose differences are the terms of that arithmetic sequence. Consider how we could find the sum of the first 100 positive integers (that is, ). Instead of adding them in order, we regroup and add . The next pair to combine is . Then . Keep going. This gives 50 pairs which each add up to , so . This insight is usually attributed to Carl Friedrich Gauss, one of the greatest mathematicians of all time, who discovered it as a child when his unpleasant elementary teacher thought he would keep the class busy by requiring them to compute the lengthy sum.  In general, using this same sort of regrouping, we find that . Incidentally, this is exactly the same as , which makes sense if you think of the triangular numbers as counting the number of handshakes that take place at a party with people: the first person shakes hands, the next shakes an additional hands and so on.  The point of all of this is that some sequences, while not arithmetic or geometric, can be interpreted as the sequence of partial sums of arithmetic and geometric sequences. Luckily there are methods we can use to compute these sums quickly.    Summing Arithmetic Sequences: Reverse and Add  arithmetic sequence summing  Here is a technique that allows us to quickly find the sum of an arithmetic sequence.    Find the sum: .    The idea is to mimic how we found the formula for triangular numbers. If we add the first and last terms, we get 472. The second term and second-to-last term also add up to 472. To keep track of everything, we might express this as follows. Call the sum . Then,                        470             2                 To find then we add 472 to itself a number of times. What number? We need to decide how many terms ( summands ) are in the sum. Since the terms form an arithmetic sequence, the th term in the sum (counting as the 0th term) can be expressed as . If then . So ranges from 0 to 156, giving 157 terms in the sum. This is the number of 472's in the sum for . Thus .  It is now easy to find : .    This will work for the sum of any arithmetic sequence. Call the sum . Reverse and add. This produces a single number added to itself many times. Find the number of times. Multiply. Divide by 2. Done.    Find a closed formula for .    Again, we have a sum of an arithmetic sequence. How many terms are in the sequence? Clearly each term in the sequence has the form (as evidenced by the last term). For which values of though? To get 6, . To get take . So to find the number of terms, we must count the number of integers in the range . This is . (There are numbers from 1 to , so one less if we start with 2.)  Now reverse and add:                              6               Since there are terms, we get .    Besides finding sums, we can use this technique to find closed formulas for sequences we recognize as sequences of partial sums.   sequence of partial sums   Use partial sums to find a closed formula for which starts     First, if you look at the differences between terms, you get a sequence of differences: , which is an arithmetic sequence. Written another way: and so on. We can write the general term of in terms of the arithmetic sequence as follows: (we use instead of to get the indices to line up correctly; for we add up to 7, which is ).  We can reverse and add, but the initial 2 does not fit our pattern. This just means we need to keep the 2 out of the reverse part:                                              Not counting the first term (the 4) there are summands of so the right-hand side becomes .  Finally, solving for we get . Just to be sure, we check , , etc. We have the correct closed formula.    Notice that the closed formula for a sequence that has a arithmetic (i.e., linear) rate of change is a quadratic function. Interesting....    Summing Geometric Sequences: Multiply, Shift and Subtract  geometric sequence summing  To find the sum of a geometric sequence, we cannot just reverse and add. Do you see why? The reason we got the same term added to itself many times is because there was a constant difference. So as we added that difference in one direction, we subtracted the difference going the other way, leaving a constant total. For geometric sums, we have a different technique.    What is ?    Multiply each term by 2, the common ratio. You get . Now subtract: . Since , we have our answer.    To better see what happened in the above example, try writing it this way:                            Then divide both sides by and we have the same result for . The idea is, by multiplying the sum by the common ratio, each term becomes the next term. We shift over the sum to get the subtraction to mostly cancel out, leaving just the first term and new last term.    Find a closed formula for .    The common ratio is 5. So we have                    Thus     Even though this might seem like a new technique, you have probably used it before.    Express as a fraction.    Let . Consider . We get:                    So . What have we done? We viewed the repeating decimal as a sum of the geometric sequence The common ratio is . The only real difference is that we are now computing an infinite geometric sum, we do not have the extra last term to consider. Really, this is the result of taking a limit as you would in calculus when you compute infinite geometric sums.    To summarize, we now can find a closed formula for a sequence that has a rate of growth that is an exponential function: , where is a geometric sequence (i.e., and exponential function). What sort of closed formula to we get here? It's another exponential function!      Match each formula on the left with the type of formula described on the right.     Arithmetic; closed     Arithmetic; recursive     Geometric; closed     Geometric; recursive     How can you decide whether a sequence is the sequence of partial sums of a arithmetic or geometric sequence?

Consider the sum    How many terms (summands) are in the sum?    Compute the sum using a technique discussed in this section.                 35.

Find the sum of all the terms in the sequence, in terms of                      terms, since to get 37 using the formula we must use    which is 11 less than (or plug in for ).    Reverse and add.

Consider the sequence (with ). By looking at the differences between terms, express the sequence as a sequence of partial sums. Then find a closed formula for the sequence by computing the th partial sum.   We have , , , , and so on. The terms in the sums are given by the arithmetic sequence . In other words, . To find the closed formula, we reverse and add. We get (we have there because there are terms in the sum for ).    Starting with any rectangle, we can create a new, larger rectangle by attaching a square to the longer side. For example, if we start with a rectangle, we would glue on a square, forming a rectangle:     On the left, a 5x5 square to the right of a rectangle with base 2 and height 5, separated by a small gap. An arrow points to the right, where a rectangle of base 7 and height 5 is shown, including a dotted line representing where the square and triangle on the left were glued together.    The next rectangle would be formed by attaching a square to the top or bottom of the rectangle.    Create a sequence of rectangles using this rule starting with a rectangle. Then write out the sequence of perimeters for the rectangles (the first term of the sequence would be 6, since the perimeter of a rectangle is 6 - the next term would be 10).    Repeat the above part this time starting with a rectangle.    Find recursive formulas for each of the sequences of perimeters you found in parts (a) and (b). Don't forget to give the initial conditions as well.    Are the sequences arithmetic? Geometric? If not, are they close to being either of these (i.e., are the differences or ratios almost constant)? Explain.       If you have enough toothpicks, you can make a large triangular grid. Below, are the triangular grids of size 1 and of size 2. The size 1 grid requires 3 toothpicks, the size 2 grid requires 9 toothpicks.     Three toothpicks arranged as the sides of an equilateral triangle.     Nine toothpicks arranged into a triangle with two toothpicks forming each edge, and an upside-down triangle in the center.       Let be the number of toothpicks required to make a size triangular grid. Write out the first 5 terms of the sequence .    Find a recursive definition for the sequence. Explain why you are correct.    Is the sequence arithmetic or geometric? If not, is it the sequence of partial sums of an arithmetic or geometric sequence? Explain why your answer is correct.    Use your results from part (c) to find a closed formula for the sequence. Show your work.       If you were to shade in a square on graph paper, you could do it the boring way (with sides parallel to the edge of the paper) or the interesting way, as illustrated below:     One square.     Five squares arranged as a plus sign. Viewed another way, the squares are arranged in three centered rows of 1, 3, and 1 squares.     13 squares arranged in five centered rows, containing 1, 3, 5, 3, and 1 square each.     25 squares arranged in rows of length 1, 3, 5, 7, 5, 3, and 1.    The interesting thing here, is that a square now has area 13. Our goal is the find a formula for the area of a (diagonal) square.   Write out the first few terms of the sequence of areas (assume , , etc). Is the sequence arithmetic or geometric? If not, is it the sequence of partial sums of an arithmetic or geometric sequence? Explain why your answer is correct, referring to the diagonal squares.    Use your results from part (a) to find a closed formula for the sequence. Show your work. Note, while there are lots of ways to find a closed formula here, you should use partial sums specifically.    Find the closed formula in as many other interesting ways as you can.       Here is a surprising use of sequences to answer a counting question: How many license plates consist of 6 symbols, using only the three numerals 1, 2, and 3 and the four letters a, b, c, and d, so that no numeral appears after any letter? For example, 31ddac , 123321 , and ababab are each acceptable license plates, but 13ba2c is not.   First answer this question by considering different cases: how many of the license plates contain no numerals? How many contain one numeral, etc.    Now use the techniques of this section to show why the answer is .       "

How many squares of all sizes are there on a chessboard? Start with smaller boards: , , , etc. Find a formula for the total number of squares in an board.   So far we have seen methods for finding the closed formulas for arithmetic and geometric sequences. Since we know how to compute the sum of the first terms of arithmetic and geometric sequences, we can compute the closed formulas for sequences which have an arithmetic (or geometric) sequence of differences between terms. But what if we consider a sequence which is the sum of the first terms of a sequence which is itself the sum of an arithmetic sequence?   chessboard counting squares on Before we get too carried away, let's consider an example: How many squares (of all sizes) are there on a chessboard? A chessboard consists of squares, but we also want to consider squares of longer side length. Even though we are only considering an board, there is already a lot to count. So instead, let us build a sequence: the first term will be the number of squares on a board, the second term will be the number of squares on a board, and so on. After a little thought, we arrive at the sequence .  This sequence is not arithmetic (or geometric for that matter), but perhaps it's sequence of differences is. For differences we get .  Not a huge surprise: one way to count the number of squares in a chessboard is to notice that there are squares with side length 1, 9 with side length 2, 4 with side length 3 and 1 with side length 4. So the original sequence is just the sum of squares. Now this sequence of differences is not arithmetic since it's sequence of differences (the differences of the differences of the original sequence) is not constant. In fact, this sequence of second differences is differences of a sequence  , which is an arithmetic sequence (with constant difference 2). Notice that our original sequence had third differences (that is, differences of differences of differences of the original) constant. We will call such a sequence -constant. The sequence has second differences constant, so it will be a -constant sequence. In general, we will say a sequence is a -constant    the th differences of a sequence   -constant sequence if the th differences are constant.    Which of the following sequences are -constant for some value of ?   .   .   .        This is the sequence from , in which we found a closed formula by recognizing the sequence as the sequence of partial sums of an arithmetic sequence. Indeed, the sequence of first differences is , which itself has differences . Thus is a -constant sequence.  These are the perfect cubes. The sequence of first differences is ; the sequence of second differences is ; the sequence of third differences is constant: . Thus the perfect cubes are a -constant sequence.  If we take first differences we get . Wait, what? That's the sequence we started with. So taking second differences will give us the same sequence again. No matter how many times we repeat this we will always have the same sequence, which in particular means no finite number of differences will be constant. Thus this sequence is not -constant for any .      The -constant sequences are themselves constant, so a closed formula for them is easy to compute (it's just the constant). The -constant sequences are arithmetic and we have a method for finding closed formulas for them as well. Every -constant sequence is the sum of an arithmetic sequence so we can find formulas for these as well. But notice that the format of the closed formula for a -constant sequence is always quadratic. For example, the square numbers are -constant with closed formula . The triangular numbers (also -constant) have closed formula , which when multiplied out gives you an term as well. It appears that every time we increase the complexity of the sequence, that is, increase the number of differences before we get constants, we also increase the degree of the polynomial used for the closed formula. We go from constant to linear to quadratic. The sequence of differences between terms tells us something about the rate of growth of the sequence. If a sequence is growing at a constant rate, then the formula for the sequence will be linear. If the sequence is growing at a rate which itself is growing at a constant rate, then the formula is quadratic. You have seen this elsewhere: if a function has a constant second derivative (rate of change) then the function must be quadratic.  This works in general:   Finite Differences   finite differences  -constant  closed formula for a sequence The closed formula for a sequence will be a degree polynomial if and only if the sequence is -constant (i.e., the th sequence of differences is constant).   This tells us that the sequence of numbers of squares on a chessboard, , which we saw to be -constant, will have a cubic (degree 3 polynomial) for its closed formula.  Now once we know what format the closed formula for a sequence will take, it is much easier to actually find the closed formula. In the case that the closed formula is a degree polynomial, we just need data points to fit the polynomial to the data.    Find a formula for the sequence . Assume .    First, check to see if the formula has constant differences at some level. The sequence of first differences is which is arithmetic, so the sequence of second differences is constant. The sequence is -constant, so the formula for will be a degree 2 polynomial. That is, we know that for some constants , , and , .  Now to find , , and . First, it would be nice to know what is, since plugging in simplifies the above formula greatly. In this case, (work backwards from the sequence of constant differences). Thus , so . Now plug in and . We get  .  At this point we have two (linear) equations and two unknowns, so we can solve the system for and (using substitution or elimination or even matrices). We find and , so .      Find a closed formula for the number of squares on an chessboard.    We have seen that the sequence is -constant, so we are looking for a degree 3 polynomial. That is, .  We can find if we know what is. Working backwards from the third differences, we find (unsurprisingly, since there are no squares on a chessboard). Thus . Now plug in , , and : .  If we solve this system of equations we get , and . Therefore the number of squares on an chessboard is .    Note: Since the squares-on-a-chessboard problem is really asking for the sum of squares, we now have a nice formula for .  Not all sequences will have polynomials as their closed formula. We can use the theory of finite differences to identify these.    Determine whether the following sequences can be described by a polynomial, and if so, of what degree.                  As we saw in , this sequence is not -constant for any . Therefore the closed formula for the sequence is not a polynomial. In fact, we know the closed formula is , which grows faster than any polynomial (so is not a polynomial).    The sequence of first differences is . The second differences are: . Third difference: . Fourth differences: . As far as we can tell, this sequence of differences is constant so the sequence is -constant and as such the closed formula is a degree 4 polynomial.    This is the Fibonacci sequence. Fibonacci sequence differences The sequence of first differences is , the second differences are . We notice that after the first few terms, we get the original sequence back. So there will never be constant differences, so the closed formula for the Fibonacci sequence is not a polynomial.         Solving Systems of Equations with Technology  The point of polynomial fitting is that if we can be sure that a sequence has a polynomial as its closed formula, then we can find that formula. Since we know the degree of the polynomial, all we need is to find it's coefficients, and with enough terms of the sequence, we can find a system of enough linear equations whose solution will be those coefficients. However, this requires solving a system of linear equations.  For a degree 2 polynomial, we need to find three coefficients (the constant term, the coefficient of , and the coefficient of ). A system of three linear equations will be enough to find these three unknowns. In fact, since will be the constant term, we can really get away with just two equations and two unknowns, and this is not difficult to solve by hand.  For higher degree polynomials, the number of equations is larger and solving by hand can be tedious. Luckily, it is easy for computers to solve these equations. Below we demonstrate how to use the free computer algebra system SageMath, as well as python, to solve these systems of equations. Besides these two choices, pretty much any computer algebra system (including Wolfram Alpha) can solve these systems of equations.  Suppose we have the following system of three equations and three unknowns, as in the chess board example above:   In SageMath, we can use the solve method to solve the system of equations. Here is the code:   This is easier than in python, but python might be more readily available. One way you can solve the system in python is to use the numpy library. In this case, you would create a matrix of coefficients and a vector of constants, and then use the solve method. Here is the code:    import numpy as np A = np.array([[1,1,1],[8,4,2],[27,9,3]]) b = np.array([1,5,14]) x = np.linalg.solve(A,b) print(x)   An explanation of what is going on here: we creating a matrix A of coefficients of the system of equations (not the coefficients of the closed formula we are looking for), and a vector b for the constants, . What numpy does is solve the matrix equation . The vector that satisfies this matrix equation will be the values of the unknowns in the system (so the vector ).  Of course, once you find the coefficients of the polynomial, you should still write out the closed formula using those coefficients. It is always a good idea to check that the formula appears to work by using an that you did not use to get your system of equations.     Match each sequence on the left with the type of closed formula it might have, on the right.

No. The sequence is geometric, and in fact has closed formula . This is an exponential function, which is not equal to any polynomial of any degree.

Give a closed formula for this sequence.    What sequence do you get if the initial conditions are , ? Give a closed formula.    What if and ? Find a closed formula.      We have seen that it is often easier to find recursive definitions than closed formulas. Lucky for us, there are a few techniques for converting recursive definitions to closed formulas. Doing so is called solving a recurrence relation . Recall that the recurrence relation is a recursive definition without the initial conditions. For example, the recurrence relation for the Fibonacci sequence Fibonacci sequence recurrence relation is . (This, together with the initial conditions and give the entire recursive definition for the sequence.)   recurrence relation finding for sequence   Find a recurrence relation and initial conditions for .    Finding the recurrence relation would be easier if we had some context for the problem (like the Tower of Hanoi, for example). Alas, we have only the sequence. Remember, the recurrence relation tells you how to get from previous terms to future terms. What is going on here? We could look at the differences between terms: . Notice that these are growing by a factor of 3. Is the original sequence as well? , , and so on. It appears that we always end up with 2 less than the next term. Aha!  So is our recurrence relation and the initial condition is .    We are going to try to solve these recurrence relations. By this we mean something very similar to solving differential equations: we want to find a function of (a closed formula) which satisfies the recurrence relation, as well as the initial condition. Recurrence relations are sometimes called difference equations since they can describe the difference between terms and this highlights the relation to differential equations further. Just like for differential equations, finding a solution might be tricky, but checking that the solution is correct is easy. difference equation recurrence relation    recurrence relation verifying solution to   Check that is a solution to the recurrence relation with .    First, it is easy to check the initial condition: should be according to our closed formula. Indeed, , which is what we want. To check that our proposed solution satisfies the recurrence relation, try plugging it in. .  That's what our recurrence relation says! We have a solution.    Sometimes we can be clever and solve a recurrence relation by inspection. We generate the sequence using the recurrence relation and keep track of what we are doing so that we can see how to jump to finding just the term. Here are two examples of how you might do that.   Telescoping  telescoping refers to the phenomenon when many terms in a large sum cancel out so the sum telescopes. For example: because every third term looks like: , and then and so on.  We can use this behavior to solve recurrence relations. Here is an example.    Solve the recurrence relation with initial term .    To get a feel for the recurrence relation, write out the first few terms of the sequence: . Look at the difference between terms. and and so on. The key thing here is that the difference between terms is . We can write this explicitly: . Of course, we could have arrived at this conclusion directly from the recurrence relation by subtracting from both sides.  Now use this equation over and over again, changing each time: .  Add all these equations together. On the right-hand side, we get the sum . We already know this can be simplified to . What happens on the left-hand side? We get .  This sum telescopes. We are left with only the from the first equation and the from the last equation. Putting this all together we have or . But we know that . So the solution to the recurrence relation, subject to the initial condition is .  (Now that we know that, we should notice that the sequence is the result of adding 4 to each of the triangular numbers.) triangular numbers     The above example shows a way to solve recurrence relations of the form where has a known closed formula. If you rewrite the recurrence relation as , and then add up all the different equations with ranging between 1 and , the left-hand side will always give you . The right-hand side will be , which is why we need to know the closed formula for that sum.  However, telescoping will not help us with a recursion such as since the left-hand side will not telescope. You will have 's but only one . However, we can still be clever if we use iteration .  We have already seen an example of iteration when we found the closed formula for arithmetic and geometric sequences. The idea is, we iterate  iteration the process of finding the next term, starting with the known initial condition, up until we have . Then we simplify. In the arithmetic sequence example, we simplified by multiplying by the number of times we add it to when we get to , to get from to .  To see how this works, let's go through the same example we used for telescoping, but this time use iteration.    Use iteration to solve the recurrence relation with .    Again, start by writing down the recurrence relation when . This time, don't subtract the terms to the other side: .  Now , but we know what is. By substitution, we get .  Now go to , using our known value of : .  We notice a pattern. Each time, we take the previous term and add the current index. So .  Regrouping terms, we notice that is just plus the sum of the integers from to . So, since , .    Of course in this case we still needed to know formula for the sum of . Let's try iteration with a sequence for which telescoping doesn't work.    Solve the recurrence relation subject to .    Again, we iterate the recurrence relation, building up to the index . .  It is difficult to see what is happening here because we have to distribute all those 3's. Let's try again, this time simplifying a bit as we go. .  Now we simplify. , so we have . Note that all the other terms have a 2 in them. In fact, we have a geometric sum with first term and common ratio . We have seen how to simplify . We get which simplifies to . Putting this together with the first term gives our closed formula: .     iteration Iteration can be messy, but when the recurrence relation only refers to one previous term (and maybe some function of ) it can work well. However, trying to iterate a recurrence relation such as will be way too complicated. We would need to keep track of two sets of previous terms, each of which were expressed by two previous terms, and so on. The length of the formula would grow exponentially (double each time, in fact). Luckily there happens to be a method for solving recurrence relations which works very well on relations like this.    The Characteristic Root Technique  characteristic roots  Suppose we want to solve a recurrence relation expressed as a combination of the two previous terms, such as . In other words, we want to find a function of which satisfies . Now iteration is too complicated, but think just for a second what would happen if we did iterate. In each step, we would, among other things, multiply a previous iteration by 6. So our closed formula would include multiplied some number of times. Thus it is reasonable to guess the solution will contain parts that look geometric. Perhaps the solution will take the form for some constant .  The nice thing is, we know how to check whether a formula is actually a solution to a recurrence relation: plug it in. What happens if we plug in into the recursion above? We get .  Now solve for : , so by factoring, or (or , although this does not help us). This tells us that is a solution to the recurrence relation, as is . Which one is correct? They both are, unless we specify initial conditions. Notice we could also have . Or . In fact, for any and , is a solution (try plugging this into the recurrence relation). To find the values of and , use the initial conditions.  This points us in the direction of a more general technique for solving recurrence relations. Notice we will always be able to factor out the as we did above. So we really only care about the other part. We call this other part the characteristic equation  characteristic equation for the recurrence relation. We are interested in finding the roots of the characteristic equation, which are called (surprise) the characteristic roots .   Characteristic Roots   characteristic roots Given a recurrence relation , the characteristic polynomial is characteristic polynomial  giving the characteristic equation : characteristic equation  .   recurrence relation solving If and are two distinct roots of the characteristic polynomial (i.e., solutions to the characteristic equation), then the solution to the recurrence relation is , where and are constants determined by the initial conditions.     Solve the recurrence relation with and .    Rewrite the recurrence relation . Now form the characteristic equation: and solve for : so and are the characteristic roots. We therefore know that the solution to the recurrence relation will have the form .  To find and , plug in and to get a system of two equations with two unknowns:   Solving this system gives and so the solution to the recurrence relation is .    Perhaps the most famous recurrence relation is , which together with the initial conditions and defines the Fibonacci sequence. Fibonacci sequence recurrence relation But notice that this is precisely the type of recurrence relation on which we can use the characteristic root technique. When you do, the only thing that changes is that the characteristic equation does not factor, so you need to use the quadratic formula to find the characteristic roots. In fact, doing so gives the third most famous irrational number, , the golden ratio . golden ratio   Before leaving the characteristic root technique, we should think about what might happen when you solve the characteristic equation. We have an example above in which the characteristic polynomial has two distinct roots. These roots can be integers, or perhaps irrational numbers (requiring the quadratic formula to find them). In these cases, we know what the solution to the recurrence relation looks like.  However, it is possible for the characteristic polynomial to have only one root. This can happen if the characteristic polynomial factors as . It is still the case that would be a solution to the recurrence relation, but we won't be able to find solutions for all initial conditions using the general form , since we can't distinguish between and . We are in luck though:   Characteristic Root Technique for Repeated Roots  characteristic roots repeated  recurrence relation solving  Suppose the recurrence relation has a characteristic polynomial with only one root . Then the solution to the recurrence relation is where and are constants determined by the initial conditions.   Notice the extra in . This allows us to solve for the constants and from the initial conditions.    Solve the recurrence relation with initial conditions and .    The characteristic polynomial is . We solve the characteristic equation by factoring: so is the only characteristic root. Therefore we know that the solution to the recurrence relation has the form for some constants and . Now use the initial conditions: . Since , we find that . Therefore the solution to the recurrence relation is .    Although we will not consider examples more complicated than these, this characteristic root technique can be applied to much more complicated recurrence relations. characteristic roots For example, has characteristic polynomial . Assuming you see how to factor such a degree 3 (or more) polynomial you can easily find the characteristic roots and as such solve the recurrence relation (the solution would look like if there were 3 distinct roots). It is also possible that the characteristics roots are complex numbers. recurrence relation solving  complex numbers (as characteristic roots)   However, the characteristic root technique is only useful for solving recurrence relations in a particular form: is given as a linear combination of some number of previous terms. These recurrence relations are called linear homogeneous recurrence relations with constant coefficients . homogeneous recurrence relation The homogeneous refers to the fact that there is no additional term in the recurrence relation other than a multiple of terms. For example, is non-homogeneous because of the additional constant 1. There are general methods of solving such things, but we will not consider them here, other than through the use of telescoping or iteration described above.     Which of the following recurrence relations would be good candidates to try the characteristic root technique on? Select all that apply          Correct: is written in terms of only multiple of previous terms.           This works too, although the characteristic polynomial will have degree 3, so finding characteristic roots will be difficult.           This looks like it is the closed formula that would result from a characteristic root technique application, but isn't a recursive formula.           The addition of the constant makes it so we cannot use the characteristic root technique directly. While there are methods for dealing with this, we have not considered them in this section.           This might be a characteristic polynomial (in fact, it is for the sequence given by ), but it is not a recursive definition itself.      At what step do you need to refer to the initial conditions when completing the characteristic root technique? What would happen if you didn't use these? Explain.     Practice Problems    Solve the recurrence relation with     Use telescoping or iteration.        We should use telescoping or iteration here.

  "body": " Induction   proof  by indcution    induction    mathematical induction  induction     induction  mathematical induction induction Mathematical induction is a proof technique, not unlike direct proof or proof by contradiction or combinatorial proof. In other words, induction is a style of argument we use to convince ourselves and others that a mathematical statement is always true. Many mathematical statements can be proved by simply explaining what they mean. Others are very difficult to prove in fact, there are relatively simple mathematical statements which nobody yet knows how to prove. To facilitate the discovery of proofs, it is important to be familiar with some standard styles of arguments. Induction is one such style. Let's start with an example:    Stamps   You need to mail a package, but don't yet know how much postage you will need. You have a large supply of 8-cent stamps and 5-cent stamps. Which amounts of postage can you make exactly using these stamps? Which amounts are impossible to make?   Perhaps in investigating the problem above you picked some amounts of postage, and then figured out whether you could make that amount using just 8-cent and 5-cent stamps. Perhaps you did this in order: can you make 1 cent of postage? Can you make 2 cents? 3 cents? And so on. If this is what you did, you were actually answering a sequence of questions. We have methods for dealing with sequences. Let's see if that helps.  Actually, we will not make a sequence of questions, but rather a sequence of statements. Let    the th case we are trying to prove by induction  be the statement you can make cents of postage using just 8-cent and 5-cent stamps. Since for each value of , is a statement, it is either true or false. So if we form the sequence of statements , the sequence will consist of 's (for true) and 's (for false). In our particular case the sequence starts because are all false (you cannot make 1, 2, 3, or 4 cents of postage) but is true (use one 5-cent stamp), and so on.  Let's think a bit about how we could find the value of for some specific (the value will be either or ). How did we find the value of the th term of a sequence of numbers? How did we find ? There were two ways we could do this: either there was a closed formula for , so we could plug in into the formula and get our output value, or we had a recursive definition for the sequence, so we could use the previous terms of the sequence to compute the th term. When dealing with sequences of statements, we could use either of these techniques as well. Maybe there is a way to use itself to determine whether we can make cents of postage. That would be something like a closed formula. Or instead we could use the previous terms in the sequence (of statements) to determine whether we can make cents of postage. That is, if we know the value of , can we get from that to the value of ? That would be something like a recursive definition for the sequence. Remember, finding recursive definitions for sequences was often easier than finding closed formulas. The same is true here.  Suppose I told you that was true (it is). Can you determine from this fact the value of (whether it true or false)? Yes you can. Even if we don't know how exactly we made 43 cents out of the 5-cent and 8-cent stamps, we do know that there was some way to do it. However we accomplished this feat, we can be sure that we used either at least three 5-cent stamps or at least three 8-cent stamps (if not, then we would have at most two of each, which is only 26 cents).  What if our total of 43 cents used at least three 5-cent stamps (making 15 cents)? We could replace those three 5-cent stamps with two 8-cent stamps (making 16 cents). The total postage has gone up by 1, so we have a way to make 44 cents, so is true. On the other hand, if we had at least three 8-cent stamps (making 24 cents), we can replace those three 8-cent stamps with five 5-cent stamps (making 25 cents) then again we have bumped up our total by 1 cent. So either way, we have a way to make 44 cents, so is true.  Notice that we have not said how to make 44 cents, just that we can, on the basis that we can make 43 cents. How do we know we can make 43 cents? Perhaps because we know we can make    the ultimate answer to life, etc.  cents, which we know we can do because we know we can make 41 cents, and so on. It's a recursion! As with a recursive definition of a numerical sequence, we must specify our initial value. In this case, the initial value is is false. That's not good, since our recurrence relation just says that is true if  is also true. We need to start the process with a true . So instead, we might want to use is true as the initial condition.  Putting this all together we arrive at the following fact: it is possible to (exactly) make any amount of postage greater than 27 cents using just 5-cent and 8-cent stamps. This is not claiming that there are no amounts less than 27 cents which can also be made. In other words, is true for any . To prove this, we could do the following:   Demonstrate that is true.    Prove that if is true, then is true (for any ).     Suppose we have done this. Then we know that the 28th term of the sequence above is a (using step 1, the initial condition or base case ), base case  induction base case and that every term after the 28th is also (using step 2, the recursive part or inductive case ). inductive case  induction inductive case Here is what the proof would actually look like.   Let be the statement it is possible to make exactly cents of postage using 5-cent and 8-cent stamps. We will show is true for all .  First, we show that is true: , so we can make cents using four 5-cent stamps and one 8-cent stamp.  Now suppose is true for some arbitrary . Then it is possible to make cents using 5-cent and 8-cent stamps. Note that since , it cannot be that we use fewer than three 5-cent stamps and fewer than three 8-cent stamps: using two of each would give only 26 cents. Now if we have made cents using at least three 5-cent stamps, replace three 5-cent stamps by two 8-cent stamps. This replaces 15 cents of postage with 16 cents, moving from a total of cents to cents. Thus is true. On the other hand, if we have made cents using at least three 8-cent stamps, then we can replace three 8-cent stamps with five 5-cent stamps, moving from 24 cents to 25 cents, giving a total of cents of postage. So in this case as well is true.  Therefore, by the principle of mathematical induction, is true for all .     Formalizing Proofs  What we did in the stamp example above works for many types of problems. Proof by induction is useful when trying to prove statements about all natural numbers, or all natural numbers greater than some fixed first case (like 28 in the example above), and in some other situations too. In particular, induction should be used when there is some way to go from one case to the next when you can see how to always do one more.   This is a big idea. Thinking about a problem inductively can give new insight into the problem. For example, to really understand the stamp problem, you should think about how any amount of postage (greater than 28 cents) can be made (this is non-inductive reasoning) and also how the ways in which postage can be made changes as the amount increases (inductive reasoning). When you are asked to provide a proof by induction, you are being asked to think about the problem dynamically ; how does increasing change the problem?  But there is another side to proofs by induction as well. In mathematics, it is not enough to understand a problem, you must also be able to communicate the problem to others. Like any discipline, mathematics has standard language and style, allowing mathematicians to share their ideas efficiently. Proofs by induction have a certain formal style, and being able to write in this style is important. It allows us to keep our ideas organized and might even help us with formulating a proof.  Here is the general structure of a proof by mathematical induction:   Induction Proof Structure  induction proof structure  proof by indcution   induction Start by saying what the statement is that you want to prove: Let be the statement To prove that is true for all , you must prove two facts:    base case  induction base case Base case: Prove that is true. You do this directly. This is often easy.     inductive case  induction inductive case Inductive case: Prove that for all . That is, prove that for any if is true, then is true as well. This is the proof of an if then statement, so you can assume is true ( is called the inductive hypothesis ). inductive hypothesis You must then explain why is also true, given that assumption.     Assuming you are successful on both parts above, you can conclude, Therefore by the principle of mathematical induction, the statement is true for all .    Sometimes the statement will only be true for values of , for example, or some other value. In such cases, replace all the 0's above with 4's (or the other value).  The other advantage of formalizing inductive proofs is it allows us to verify that the logic behind this style of argument is valid. Why does induction work? Think of a row of dominoes set up standing on their edges. We want to argue that in a minute, all the dominoes will have fallen down. For this to happen, you will need to push the first domino. That is the base case. It will also have to be that the dominoes are close enough together that when any particular domino falls, it will cause the next domino to fall. That is the inductive case. If both of these conditions are met, you push the first domino over and each domino will cause the next to fall, then all the dominoes will fall.  Induction is powerful! Think how much easier it is to knock over dominoes when you don't have to push over each domino yourself. You just start the chain reaction, and the rely on the relative nearness of the dominoes to take care of the rest.  Think about our study of sequences. It is easier to find recursive definitions for sequences than closed formulas. Going from one case to the next is easier than going directly to a particular case. That is what is so great about induction. Instead of going directly to the (arbitrary) case for , we just need to say how to get from one case to the next.  When you are asked to prove a statement by mathematical induction, you should first think about why the statement is true, using inductive reasoning. Explain why induction is the right thing to do, and roughly why the inductive case will work. Then, sit down and write out a careful, formal proof using the structure above.    Examples  Here are some examples of proof by mathematical induction.    Prove for each natural number that .    First, let's think inductively about this equation. In fact, we know this is true for other reasons (reverse and add comes to mind). But why might induction be applicable? The left-hand side adds up the numbers from 1 to . If we know how to do that, adding just one more term ( ) would not be that hard. For example, if , suppose we know that the sum of the first 100 numbers is (so , which is true). Now to find the sum of the first 101 numbers, it makes more sense to just add 101 to 5050, instead of computing the entire sum again. We would have . In fact, it would always be easy to add just one more term. This is why we should use induction.  Now the formal proof:   Let be the statement . We will show that is true for all natural numbers .  Base case: is the statement which is clearly true.  Inductive case: Let be a natural number. Assume (for induction) that is true. That means . We will prove that is true as well. That is, we must prove that . To prove this equation, start by adding to both sides of the inductive hypothesis: .  Now, simplifying the right side we get: .  Thus is true, so by the principle of mathematical induction is true for all natural numbers .     Note that in the part of the proof in which we proved from , we used the equation . This was the inductive hypothesis. inductive hypothesis Seeing how to use the inductive hypotheses is usually straight forward when proving a fact about a sum like this. In other proofs, it can be less obvious where it fits in.    Prove that for all , is a multiple of 5.    Again, start by understanding the dynamics of the problem. What does increasing do? Let's try with a few examples. If , then yes, is a multiple of 5. What does incrementing to 2 look like? We get , which again is a multiple of 5. Next, : but instead of just finding , what did the increase in do? We will still subtract 1, but now we are multiplying by another 6 first. Viewed another way, we are multiplying a number which is one more than a multiple of 5 by 6 (because is a multiple of 5, so is one more than a multiple of 5). What do numbers which are one more than a multiple of 5 look like? They must have last digit 1 or 6. What happens when you multiply such a number by 6? Depends on the number, but in any case, the last digit of the new number must be a 6. And then if you subtract 1, you get last digit 5, so a multiple of 5.  The point is, every time we multiply by just one more six, we still get a number with last digit 6, so subtracting 1 gives us a multiple of 5. Now the formal proof:   Let be the statement, is a multiple of 5. We will prove that is true for all .  Base case: is true: which is a multiple of 5.  Inductive case: Let be an arbitrary natural number. Assume, for induction, that is true. That is, is a multiple of . Then for some integer . This means that . Multiply both sides by : .  But we want to know about , so subtract 1 from both sides: .  Of course , so is a multiple of 5.  Therefore is a multiple of 5, or in other words, is true. Thus, by the principle of mathematical induction is true for all .     We had to be a little bit clever (i.e., use some algebra) to locate the inside of before we could apply the inductive hypothesis. This is what can make inductive proofs challenging.  In the two examples above, we started with or . We can start later if we need to.    Prove that for all integers .    First, the idea of the argument. What happens when we increase by 1? On the left-hand side, we increase the base of the square and go to the next square number. On the right-hand side, we increase the power of 2. This means we double the number. So the question is, how does doubling a number relate to increasing to the next square? Think about what the difference of two consecutive squares looks like. We have . This factors: .  But doubling the right-hand side increases it by , since . When is large enough, .  What we are saying here is that each time increases, the left-hand side grows by less than the right-hand side. So if the left-hand side starts smaller (as it does when ), it will never catch up. Now the formal proof:   Let be the statement . We will prove is true for all integers .  Base case: is the statement . Since and , we see that is indeed true.  Inductive case: Let be an arbitrary integer. Assume, for induction, that is true. That is, assume . We will prove that is true, i.e., . To prove such an inequality, start with the left-hand side and work towards the right-hand side:   Following the equalities and inequalities through, we get , in other words, . Therefore by the principle of mathematical induction, is true for all .     The previous example might remind you of the racetrack principle from calculus, racetrack principle which says that if , and for , then for . Same idea: the larger function is increasing at a faster rate than the smaller function, so the larger function will stay larger. In discrete math, we don't have derivatives, so we look at differences. Thus induction is the way to go.   Warning:  induction incorrect use of  With great power, comes great responsibility. Induction isn't magic. It seems very powerful to be able to assume is true. After all, we are trying to prove is true and the only difference is in the variable: vs. . Are we assuming that what we want to prove is true? Not really. We assume is true only for the sake of proving that is true.  Still you might start to believe that you can prove anything with induction. Consider this incorrect proof that every Canadian Canadians, set of has the same eye color: Let be the statement that any Canadians have the same eye color. is true, since everyone has the same eye color as themselves. Now assume is true. That is, assume that in any group of Canadians, everyone has the same eye color. Now consider an arbitrary group of Canadians. The first of these must all have the same eye color, since is true. Also, the last of these must have the same eye color, since is true. So in fact, everyone the group must have the same eye color. Thus is true. So by the principle of mathematical induction, is true for all .  Clearly something went wrong. The problem is that the proof that implies assumes that . We have only shown is true. In fact, is false. Try this: read through the previous paragraph again, substituting for each . Can you spot the error in that argument?      Strong Induction  induction strong  strong induction induction, strong   Start with a square piece of paper. You want to cut this square into smaller squares, leaving no waste (every piece of paper you end up with must be a square). Obviously it is possible to cut the square into 4 squares. You can also cut it into 9 squares. It turns out you can cut the square into 7 squares (although not all the same size). What other numbers of squares could you end up with?   Sometimes, to prove that is true, it would be helpful to know that  and   and  are all true. Consider the following puzzle:   puzzle chocolate bar  You have a rectangular chocolate bar, made up of identical squares of chocolate. You can take such a bar and break it along any row or column. How many times will you have to break the bar to reduce it to single chocolate squares?   At first, this question might seem impossible. Perhaps I meant to ask for the smallest number of breaks needed? Let's investigate.  Start with some small cases. If , you must have a rectangle, which can be reduced to single pieces in one break. With , we must have a bar, which requires two breaks: the first break creates a single square and a bar, which we know takes one (more) break.  What about ? Now we could have a bar, or a bar. In the first case, break the bar into two bars, each which require one more break (that's a total of three breaks required). If we started with a bar, we have choices for our first break. We could break the bar in half, creating two bars, or we could break off a single square, leaving a bar. But either way, we still need two more breaks, giving a total of three.  It is starting to look like no matter how we break the bar (and no matter how the squares are arranged into a rectangle), we will always have the same number of breaks required. It also looks like that number is one less than :    Given a -square rectangular chocolate bar, it always takes breaks to reduce the bar to single squares.    It makes sense to prove this by induction because after breaking the bar once, you are left with smaller chocolate bars. Reducing to smaller cases is what induction is all about. We can inductively assume we already know how to deal with these smaller bars. The problem is, if we are trying to prove the inductive case about a -square bar, we don't know that after the first break the remaining bar will have squares. So we really need to assume that our conjecture is true for all cases less than .  Is it valid to make this stronger assumption? Remember, in induction we are attempting to prove that is true for all . What if that were not the case? Then there would be some first for which was false. Since is the first counterexample, we know that is true for all . Now we proceed to prove that is actually true, based on the assumption that is true for all smaller .  This is quite an advantage: we now have a stronger inductive hypothesis. inductive hypothesis strong We can assume that , , ,  is true, just to show that is true. Previously, we just assumed for this purpose.  It is slightly easier if we change our variables for strong induction. Here is what the formal proof would look like:   Strong Induction Proof Structure  induction strong  Again, start by saying what you want to prove: Let be the statement Then establish two facts:   Base case: Prove that is true. base case  induction base case for strong induction     Inductive case: Assume is true for all . Prove that is true. inductive case  induction inductive case for strong induction    Conclude, therefore, by strong induction, is true for all .    Of course, it is acceptable to replace 0 with a larger base case if needed. Technically, strong induction does not require you to prove a separate base case. This is because when proving the inductive case, you must show that is true, assuming is true for all . But this is not any help so you end up proving anyway. To be on the safe side, we will always include the base case separately.  Let's prove our conjecture about the chocolate bar puzzle:   Let be the statement, it takes breaks to reduce a -square chocolate bar to single squares.   Base case: Consider . The squares must be arranged into a rectangle, and we require breaks to reduce this to single squares.  Inductive case: Fix an arbitrary and assume is true for all . Consider a -square rectangular chocolate bar. Break the bar once along any row or column. This results in two chocolate bars, say of sizes and . That is, we have an -square rectangular chocolate bar, a -square rectangular chocolate bar, and .  We also know that and , so by our inductive hypothesis, and are true. To reduce the -square bar to single squares takes breaks; to reduce the -square bar to single squares takes breaks. Doing this results in our original bar being reduced to single squares. All together it took the initial break, plus the and breaks, for a total of breaks. Thus is true.  Therefore, by strong induction, is true for all .   Here is a more mathematically relevant example:    Prove that any natural number greater than 1 is either prime prime numbers or can be written as the product of primes.    First, the idea: if we take some number , maybe it is prime. If so, we are done. If not, then it is composite, so it is the product of two smaller numbers. Each of these factors is smaller than (but at least 2), so we can repeat the argument with these numbers. We have reduced to a smaller case.  Now the formal proof:   Let be the statement, is either prime or can be written as the product of primes. We will prove is true for all .  Base case: is true because is indeed prime.  Inductive case: assume is true for all . We want to show that is true. That is, we want to show that is either prime or is the product of primes. If is prime, we are done. If not, then has more than 2 divisors, so we can write , with and less than (and greater than 1). By the inductive hypothesis, and are each either prime or can be written as the product of primes. In either case, we have that is written as the product of primes.  Thus by the strong induction, is true for all .     Whether you use regular induction or strong induction depends on the statement you want to prove. If you wanted to be safe, you could always use strong induction. It really is stronger , so can accomplish everything weak induction can. induction contrasting regular and strong That said, using regular induction is often easier since there is only one place you can use the induction hypothesis. There is also something to be said for elegance in proofs. If you can prove a statement using simpler tools, it is nice to do so.   induction contrasting regular and strong As a final contrast between the two forms of induction, consider once more the stamp problem. Regular induction worked by showing how to increase postage by one cent (either replacing three 5-cent stamps with two 8-cent stamps, or three 8-cent stamps with five 5-cent stamps). We could give a slightly different proof using strong induction. First, we could show five base cases: it is possible to make 28, 29, 30, 31, and 32 cents (we would actually say how each of these is made). Now assume that it is possible to make cents of postage for all as long as . As long as , this means in particular we can make cents. Now add a 5-cent stamp to get make cents.     Suppose you wanted to prove, using mathematical induction, that for all values of . Which of the following would be an appropriate first line of the proof? Select all that apply.     Let be the statement .     Correct. Note in particular, we do not include the for all as part of the definition of .      For each , let be the statement, the sum of the first odd numbers is .     This is correct. Note that saying that we define for each is different from saying that includes ...for all .       Assume for all .    This is what you are trying to prove, so you cannot assume it. Later in the proof (in the inductive case) we will assume that is true for some arbitrary , but this is not assuming it is true for all at once.      Let be the statement, for all .     This doesn't make sense: what would be? That for all ??      Since , the base case is true.    Two problems here: first, you need to say what is. Second, is a statement, so it cannot be equal to the number 1.      Suppose you wanted to prove that for all . Write the first line of a proof by induction.     Practice Problems   Suppose you are trying to prove, by mathematical induction, that a statement is true for all . What would you attempt to prove in the induction step of the proof? (Select all that apply.)     That assuming is true for an arbitrary , we can prove that is true.      That implies for all .

Drag statements from the left column to the right column to create a correct proof by induction that the recurrence relation , with initial condition has closed formula .    Let be the statement, .    Note that , so is true.    Now assume that is true for an arbitrary integer .    Then .    By the recurrence relation, we have .    This simplifies to , so is true.    Therefore, by the Principle of Mathematical Induction, is true for all .    Now assume that is true for an arbitrary integer .    Then , so is true.     Drag statements from the left column to the right column to create a correct proof by induction that for all , the number is a multiple of .    Let be the statement, is a multiple of .     Note that , so definitely multiple of .    Now assume that is true for an arbitrary integers .    Then for some integer .    Since , we see that is a multiple of .    Thus is true.    Therefore, by the Principle of Mathematical Induction, is true for all .    Note that by difference of squares, so a multiple of 13.    Now assume that is true for all .    Thus , which must also be a multiple of 13.     Drag statements from the left column to the right column to create a correct proof by induction that for all , , where is the th Fibonacci Number.

Thus is true, and therefore by the Principle of Mathematical Induction, is true for all .    For the base case, note that .    Then by the inductive hypothesis, .    Subtracting from both sides gives us , which we also assumed to be true.      Additional Exercises   On the way to the market, you exchange your cow for some magic dark chocolate espresso beans. These beans have the property that every night at midnight, each bean splits into two, effectively doubling your collection. You decide to take advantage of this and each morning (around 8am) you eat 5 beans.   Explain why it is true that if at noon on day you have a number of beans ending in a 5, then at noon on day you will still have a number of beans ending in a 5.    Why is the previous fact not enough to conclude that you will always have a number of beans ending in a 5? What additional fact would you need?    Assuming you have the additional fact in part (b), and have successfully proved the fact in part (a), how do you know that you will always have a number of beans ending in a 5? Illustrate what is going on by carefully explaining how the two facts above prove that you will have a number of beans ending in a 5 on day 4 specifically. In other words, explain why induction works in this context.         If we have a number of beans ending in a 5 and we double it, we will get a number of beans ending in a 0 (since ). Then if we subtract 5, we will once again get a number of beans ending in a 5. Thus if on any day we have a number ending in a 5, the next day will also have a number ending in a 5.    If you don't start with a number of beans ending in a 5 (on day 1), the above reasoning is still correct but not helpful. For example, if you start with a number ending in a 3, the next day you will have a number ending in a 1.    Part (b) is the base case and part (a) is the inductive case. If on day 1 we have a number ending in a 5 (by part (b)), then on day 2 we will also have a number ending in a 5 (by part (a)). Then by part (a) again, we will have a number ending in a 5 on day 3. By part (a) again, this means we will have a number ending in a 5 on day 4  The proof by induction would say that on every day we will have a number ending in a 5, and this works because we can start with the base case, then use the inductive case over and over until we get up to our desired .       Use induction to prove for all that .    We must prove that for all . Thus let be the statement . We will prove that is true for all . First we establish the base case, , which claims that . Since , we see that is true. Now for the inductive case. Assume that is true for an arbitrary . That is, . We must show that is true (i.e., that ). To do this, we start with the left-hand side of and work to the right-hand side:   Thus is true so by the principle of mathematical induction, is true for all .     Prove that is a multiple of 6 for all .    Let be the statement is a multiple of 6. We will show is true for all . First we establish the base case, . Since , and is a multiple of 6, is true. Now for the inductive case. Assume holds for an arbitrary . That is, is a multiple of 6, or in other words, for some integer . Now consider :   Therefore is a multiple of 6, or in other words, is true. Therefore by the principle of mathematical induction, is true for all .     Prove that for all .    Let be the statement . We will prove that is true for all . First the base case, . We have which is true, so is established. Now the inductive case. Assume that is true for some fixed arbitrary . That is, . We will now prove that is also true (i.e., that ). We start with the left-hand side of and work to the right-hand side:   Thus holds, so by the principle of mathematical induction, is true for all .    Fibonacci sequence partial sums  Prove that where is the th Fibonacci number.    Let be the statement . We will show that is true for all . First the base case is easy because and so . Now consider the inductive case. Assume is true, that is, assume . To establish we work from left to right:   Therefore , which is to say holds. Therefore by the principle of mathematical induction, is true for all .     Prove that for all . (Recall, .)    Let be the statement . We will show is true for all . First, we check the base case and see that yes, (as ) so is true. Now for the inductive case. Assume is true for an arbitrary . That is, . Now consider : . To prove this, we start with the left side and work to the right side.   Therefore so we have established . Thus by the principle of mathematical induction is true for all .    Fibonacci sequence partial sums  Prove, by mathematical induction, that , where is the th Fibonacci number ( , and ).   zombies  Zombie Euler and Zombie Cauchy, two famous zombie mathematicians, have just signed up for Twitter accounts. After one day, Zombie Cauchy has more followers than Zombie Euler. Each day after that, the number of new followers of Zombie Cauchy is exactly the same as the number of new followers of Zombie Euler (and neither lose any followers). Explain how a proof by mathematical induction can show that on every day after the first day, Zombie Cauchy will have more followers than Zombie Euler. That is, explain what the base case and inductive case are, and why they together prove that Zombie Cauchy will have more followers on the 4th day.   football (American)  Find the largest number of points which a football team cannot get exactly using just 3-point field goals and 7-point touchdowns (ignore the possibilities of safeties, missed extra points, and two point conversions). Prove your answer is correct by mathematical induction.   It is not possible to score exactly 11 points. Can you prove that you can score points for any ?    Prove that the sum of squares can be found as follows .   interior angles  Prove that the sum of the interior angles of a convex -gon is . (A convex -gon is a polygon with sides for which each interior angle is less than .)   Start with -gon and divide it up into a -gon and a triangle.    What is wrong with the following proof of the fact that for all values of (besides of course that the thing it is claiming to prove is false)?   Let be the statement that . We will prove that is true for all . Assume, for induction that is true. That is, . We must show that is true. Now since , add 1 to both sides. This gives . Regrouping . But this is simply . Thus by the principle of mathematical induction is true for all .    The only problem is that we never established the base case. Of course, when , .    The proof in the previous problem does not work. But if we modify the fact, we can get a working proof. Prove that for all values of . You can do this proof with algebra (without induction), but the goal of this exercise is to write out a valid induction proof.    Let be the statement that . We will prove that is true for all . First, note that the base case holds: . Now assume for induction that is true. That is, . We must show that is true. Now since , add 1 to both sides. This gives . Regrouping . But this is simply . Thus by the principle of mathematical induction is true for all .     Find the flaw in the following proof of the fact that for every .   Let be the statement . We will prove is true for all . First we establish the base case: when , is true, because . Now for the inductive step, assume is true. That is, . Now if , then is some number, like 80. Of course which is still less than 100. So as well. But this is what claims, so we have shown that . Thus by the principle of mathematical induction, is true for all .    The problem here is that while is true, and while for some values of , there is at least one value of (namely ) when that implication fails. For a valid proof by induction, must be true for all values of greater than or equal to the base case.    While the above proof does not work (it better not since the statement it is trying to prove is false!) we can prove something similar. Prove that there is a strictly increasing sequence of numbers (not necessarily integers) such that for all . (By strictly increasing we mean for all . So each term must be larger than the last.)   For the inductive step, you can assume you have a strictly increasing sequence up to where . Now you just need to find the next term so that . What should be?    What is wrong with the following proof of the fact that for all , the number is odd?   Let be the statement is odd. We will prove that is true for all . Suppose for induction that is true, that is, that is odd. Now consider the statement . Now . By the inductive hypothesis, is odd, and of course is even. An odd plus an even is always odd, so therefore is odd. Therefore by the principle of mathematical induction, is true for all .    We once again failed to establish the base case: when , which is even, not odd.    Now give a valid proof (by induction, even though you might be able to do so without using induction) of the statement, for all , the number is even.    For the inductive case, you will need to show that is even. Factor this out and locate the part of it that is . What have you assumed about that quantity?   sequence of partial sums  Prove that there is a sequence of positive real numbers such that the partial sum is strictly less than for all . Hint: think about how you could define what is to make the induction argument work.   This is similar to , although there you were showing that a sequence had all its terms less than some value, and here you are showing that the sum is less than some value. But the partial sums forms a sequence, so this is actually very similar.   binary representation  Prove that every positive integer is either a power of 2, or can be written as the sum of distinct powers of 2.   The proof will be by strong induction.   Let be the statement is either a power of 2 or can be written as the sum of distinct powers of 2. We will show that is true for all .  Base case: is a power of 2, so is true.  Inductive case: Suppose is true for all . Now if is a power of 2, we are done. If not, let be the largest power of 2 strictly less than . Consider , which is a smaller number, in fact smaller than both and . Thus is either a power of 2 or can be written as the sum of distinct powers of 2, but none of them are going to be , so the together with we have written as the sum of distinct powers of 2.  Therefore, by the principle of (strong) mathematical induction, is true for all .    Fibonacci sequence  Prove, using strong induction, that every natural number is either a Fibonacci number or can be written as the sum of distinct Fibonacci numbers.   As with the previous question, we will want to subtract something from in the inductive step. There we subtracted the largest power of 2 less than . So what should you subtract here?  Note, you will still need to take care here that the sum you get from the inductive hypothesis, together with the number you subtracted will be a sum of distinct Fibonacci numbers. In fact, you could prove that the Fibonacci numbers in the sum are non-consecutive!   handshakes  Use induction to prove that if people all shake hands with each other, that the total number of handshakes is .   We have already proved this without using induction, but looking at it inductively sheds light onto the problem (and is fun).  The question you need to answer to complete the inductive step is, how many new handshakes take place when a person enters the room. Why does adding this give you the correct formula?    Suppose that a particular real number has the property that is an integer. Prove that is an integer for all natural numbers .   You will need to use strong induction. For the inductive case, try multiplying and collect which terms together are integers.   Pascal's triangle sum of row in  Use induction to prove that . That is, the sum of the th row of Pascal's Triangle is .   Here's the idea: since every entry in Pascal's Triangle is the sum of the two entries above it, we can get the st row by adding up all the pairs of entry from the th row. But doing this uses each entry on the th row twice. Thus each time we drop to the next row, we double the total. Of course, row 0 has sum (the base case). Now try to make this precise with a formal induction proof. You will use the fact that for the inductive case.   hockey stick theorem  Use induction to prove . (This is an example of the hockey stick theorem.)   To see why this works, try it on a copy of Pascal's triangle. We are adding up the entries along a diagonal, starting with the 1 on the left-hand side of the 4th row. Suppose we add up the first 5 entries on this diagonal. The claim is that the sum is the entry below and to the left of the last of these 5 entries. Note that if this is true, and we instead add up the first 6 entries, we will need to add the entry one spot to the right of the previous sum. But these two together give the entry below them, which is below and left of the last of the 6 entries on the diagonal. If you follow that, you can see what is going on. But it is not a great proof. A formal induction proof is needed.    Use the product rule for logarithms ( ) to prove, by induction on , that , for all natural numbers .   The idea here is that if we take the logarithm of , we can increase by 1 if we multiply by another (inside the logarithm). This results in adding 1 more to the total.   Let be the statement . The base case, is true, because , by the product rule for logarithms. Now assume, for induction, that is true. That is, . Consider . We have , with the last equality due to the inductive hypothesis. But this simplifies to , establishing . Therefore by the principle of mathematical induction, is true for all .    differentiable functions generalized sum rule  Let be differentiable functions. Prove, using induction, that .  You may assume for any differentiable functions and .   You are allowed to assume the base case. For the inductive case, group all but the last function together as one sum of functions, then apply the usual sum of derivatives rule, and then the inductive hypothesis.   differentiable functions generalized product rule  Suppose are differentiable functions. Use mathematical induction to prove the generalized product rule: .  You may assume the product rule for two functions is true.   For the inductive step, we know by the product rule for two functions that .  Then use the inductive hypothesis on the first summand, and distribute.    double induction induction, double induction double Fibonacci sequence identity  Here is an example of a more complicated induction technique called double induction .   You will prove that the Fibonacci numbers satisfy the identity . One way to do this is to prove the more general identity, , and realize that when we get our desired result.  Note that we now have two variables, so we want to prove this for all  and all at the same time. For each such pair , let be the statement    First fix and give a proof by mathematical induction that holds for all . Note this proof will be very easy.    Now fix an arbitrary and give a proof by strong mathematical induction that holds for all .    You can now conclude that holds for all . Do you believe that? Explain why this sort of induction is valid. For example, why do your proofs above guarantee that is true?        puzzle square division  Given a square, you can cut the square into smaller squares by cutting along lines parallel to the sides of the original square (these lines do not need to travel the entire side length of the original square). For example, by cutting along the lines below, you will divide a square into 6 smaller squares:     One large square with five squares of half the side length wrapping around the top and right side, forming an even larger square.    Prove, using strong induction, that it is possible to cut a square into smaller squares for any .   You will need three base cases. This is a very good hint actually, as it suggests that to prove is true, you would want to use the fact that is true. So somehow you need to increase the number of squares by 3.    "

Then it is possible to make cents using 5-cent and 8-cent stamps. Note that since , it cannot be that we use fewer than three 5-cent stamps and fewer than three 8-cent stamps: using two of each would give only 26 cents.

But why might induction be applicable? The left-hand side adds up the numbers from 1 to . If we know how to do that, adding just one more term ( ) would not be that hard. For example, if , suppose we know that the sum of the first 100 numbers is (so , which is true). Now to find the sum of the first 101 numbers, it makes more sense to just add 101 to 5050, instead of computing the entire sum again. We would have .

We will still subtract 1, but now we are multiplying by another 6 first. Viewed another way, we are multiplying a number which is one more than a multiple of 5 by 6 (because is a multiple of 5, so is one more than a multiple of 5). What do numbers which are one more than a multiple of 5 look like? They must have last digit 1 or 6. What happens when you multiply such a number by 6? Depends on the number, but in any case, the last digit of the new number must be a 6. And then if you subtract 1, you get last digit 5, so a multiple of 5.  The point is, every time we multiply by just one more six, we still get a number with last digit 6, so subtracting 1 gives us a multiple of 5.

  "body": " On the way to the market, you exchange your cow for some magic dark chocolate espresso beans. These beans have the property that every night at midnight, each bean splits into two, effectively doubling your collection. You decide to take advantage of this and each morning (around 8am) you eat 5 beans.   Explain why it is true that if at noon on day you have a number of beans ending in a 5, then at noon on day you will still have a number of beans ending in a 5.    Why is the previous fact not enough to conclude that you will always have a number of beans ending in a 5? What additional fact would you need?    Assuming you have the additional fact in part (b), and have successfully proved the fact in part (a), how do you know that you will always have a number of beans ending in a 5? Illustrate what is going on by carefully explaining how the two facts above prove that you will have a number of beans ending in a 5 on day 4 specifically. In other words, explain why induction works in this context.         If we have a number of beans ending in a 5 and we double it, we will get a number of beans ending in a 0 (since ). Then if we subtract 5, we will once again get a number of beans ending in a 5. Thus if on any day we have a number ending in a 5, the next day will also have a number ending in a 5.    If you don't start with a number of beans ending in a 5 (on day 1), the above reasoning is still correct but not helpful. For example, if you start with a number ending in a 3, the next day you will have a number ending in a 1.    Part (b) is the base case and part (a) is the inductive case. If on day 1 we have a number ending in a 5 (by part (b)), then on day 2 we will also have a number ending in a 5 (by part (a)). Then by part (a) again, we will have a number ending in a 5 on day 3. By part (a) again, this means we will have a number ending in a 5 on day 4  The proof by induction would say that on every day we will have a number ending in a 5, and this works because we can start with the base case, then use the inductive case over and over until we get up to our desired .

  "body": " Chapter Summary    Each day your supply of magic chocolate covered espresso beans doubles (each one splits in half), but then you eat 5 of them. You have 10 at the start of day 0.   Write out the first few terms of the sequence. Then give a recursive definition for the sequence and explain how you know it is correct.    Prove, using induction, that the last digit of the number of beans you have on the th day is always a 5 for all .    Find a closed formula for the th term of the sequence and prove it is correct by induction.      In this chapter we explored sequences and mathematical induction. At first these might not seem entirely related, but there is a link: recursive reasoning. When we have many cases (maybe infinitely many), it is often easier to describe a particular case by saying how it relates to other cases, instead of describing it absolutely. For sequences, we can describe the th term in the sequence by saying how it is related to the previous term. When showing a statement involving the variable is true for all values of , we can describe why the case for is true on the basis of why the case for is true.  While thinking of problems recursively is often easier than thinking of them absolutely (at least after you get used to thinking in this way), our ultimate goal is to move beyond this recursive description. For sequences, we want to find closed formulas for the th term of the sequence. For proofs, we want to know the statement is actually true for a particular (not only under the assumption that the statement is true for the previous value of ). In this chapter we saw some methods for moving from recursive descriptions to absolute descriptions.     If the terms of a sequence increase by a constant difference or constant ratio (these are both recursive descriptions), then the sequences are arithmetic or geometric, respectively, and we have closed formulas for each of these based on the initial terms and common difference or ratio.    If the terms of a sequence increase at a polynomial rate (that is, if the differences between terms form a sequence with a polynomial closed formula), then the sequence is itself given by a polynomial closed formula (of degree one more than the sequence of differences).    If the terms of a sequence increase at an exponential rate, then we expect the closed formula for the sequence to be exponential. These sequences often have relatively nice recursive formulas, and the characteristic root technique allows us to find the closed formula for these sequences.    If we want to prove that a statement is true for all values of (greater than some first small value), and we can describe why the statement being true for implies the statement is true for , then the principle of mathematical induction gives us that the statement is true for all values of (greater than the base case).     Throughout the chapter we tried to understand why these facts listed above are true. In part, that is what proofs, by induction or not, attempt to accomplish: they explain why mathematical truths are in fact truths. As we develop our ability to reason about mathematics, it is a good idea to make sure that the methods of our reasoning are sound. The branch of mathematics that deals with deciding whether reasoning is good or not is mathematical logic , the subject of the next chapter.

  "body": " Sets   Note that this section contains a lot of detail on what we can say about sets. If you have never seen anything about unions or Venn diagrams, it is worth reading this carefully.  The most fundamental objects we will use in our studies (and really in all of math) are sets . Much of what follows might be review, but it is very important that you are fluent in the language of set theory. Most of the notation we use below is standard, although some might be a little different than what you have seen before.  For us, a set  set will simply be an unordered collection of objects. Two examples: we could consider the set of all actors who have played The Doctor on Doctor Who , Doctor Who or the set of natural numbers between 1 and 10 inclusive. In the first case, Tom Baker is an element (or member) of the set, while Idris Elba, among many others, is not an element of the set. Also, the two examples are of different sets. Two sets are equal exactly if they contain the exact same elements. For example, the set containing all of the vowels in the declaration of independence is precisely the same set as the set of vowels in the word questionably (namely, all of them); we do not care about order or repetitions, just whether the element is in the set or not.    Notation  set notation for  We need some notation to make talking about sets easier. Consider, .  This is read, is the set containing the elements 1, 2 and 3. We use curly braces to enclose elements of a set. Some more notation: .  The symbol is read is in or is an element of.  element of a set Thus the above means that is an element of the set containing the letters , , and . Note that this is a true statement. It would also be true to say that is not in that set: .  Be warned: we write when we wish to express that one of the elements of the set is . For example, consider the set, .  This is a strange set, to be sure. It contains four elements: the number 1, the letter b, the set , and the empty set , the set containing no elements. Is in ? The answer is no. None of the four elements in are the letter , so we must conclude that . Similarly, consider the set . Even though the elements of are elements of , we cannot say that the set  is one of the elements of . Therefore . (Soon we will see that is a subset of , but this is different from being an element of .)  We have described the sets above by listing their elements. Sometimes this is hard to do, especially when there are a lot of elements in the set (perhaps infinitely many). For instance, if we want to be the set of all even natural numbers, would could write, , but this is a little imprecise. A better way would be .  Let's look at this carefully. First, there are some new symbols to digest: is the symbol usually used to denote that natural numbers , which we will take to be the set . Next, the colon, : , is read such that ; it separates the elements that are in the set from the condition that the elements in the set must satisfy. So putting this all together, we would read the set as, the set of all in the natural numbers, such that there exists some in the natural numbers for which is twice . In other words, the set of all natural numbers, that are even. Here is another way to write the same set. .  Note: Sometimes mathematicians use or for the such that symbol instead of the colon. Also, there is a fairly even split between mathematicians about whether is an element of the natural numbers, so be careful there.   set builder notation This notation is usually called set builder notation . It tells us how to build a set by telling us precisely the condition elements must meet to gain access (the condition is the logical statement after the symbol). Reading and comprehending sets written in this way takes practice. Here are some more examples:    Describe each of the following sets both in words and by listing out enough elements to see the pattern.    .  .  .  .         This is the set of all numbers which are 3 less than a natural number (i.e., that if you add 3 to them, you get a natural number). The set could also be written as (note that 0 is a natural number, so is in this set because ).    This is the set of all natural numbers which are 3 less than a natural number. So here we just have .    This is the set of all integers integers, set of  set of integers (positive and negative whole numbers, written ). In other words, .    Here we want all numbers such that and are natural numbers. There is only one: 0. So we have the set .       There is also a subtle variation on set builder notation. While the condition is generally given after the such that , sometimes it is hidden in the first part. Here is an example.    List a few elements in the sets below and describe them in words. The set is the set of integers ; positive and negative whole numbers.                   The set of integers that pass the condition that their square is a natural number. Well, every integer, when you square it, gives you a non-negative integer, so a natural number. Thus .    Here we are looking for the set of all s where is a natural number. So this set is simply the set of perfect squares. .  Another way we could have written this set, using more strict set builder notation, would be as .       We already have a lot of notation, and there is more yet. Below is a handy chart of symbols. Some of these will be discussed in greater detail as we move forward.   Special sets      The empty set is the set which contains no elements.   the empty set   empty set      The universe set is the set of all elements.   universe set (domain of discourse)   universe set  domain of discourse universe set      The set of natural numbers.

Relationships Between Sets  set relationships between  We have already said what it means for two sets to be equal: they have exactly the same elements. Thus, for example, .  (Remember, the order the elements are written down in does not matter.) Also, since these are all ways to write the set containing the first three positive integers (how we write them doesn't matter, just what they are).  What about the sets and ? Clearly , but notice that every element of is also an element of . Because of this we say that is a subset  subset of , or in symbols or . Both symbols are read is a subset of. The difference is that sometimes we want to say that is either equal to or is a subset of , in which case we use . This is analogous to the difference between and .    Let , , and . Determine which of the following are true, false, or meaningless.    .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .         False. For example, but .    True. Every element in is an element in .    False.

Everything in the empty set (nothing) is also an element of . Notice that the empty set is a subset of every set.    Meaningless. A set cannot be less than another set.    True. is one of the elements of the set .    Meaningless. is not a set, so it cannot be a subset of another set.    True. is the only element of the set , and is an element of , so every element in is an element of .       In the example above, is a subset of . You might wonder what other sets are subsets of . If you collect all these subsets of into a new set, we get a set of sets. We call the set of all subsets of the power set  power set of , and write it .    Let . Find .     is a set of sets, all of which are subsets of . So .  Notice that while , it is wrong to write since none of the elements in are numbers! On the other hand, we do have because .  What does a subset of look like? Notice that because not everything in is in . But we do have . The only element of is the set which is also an element of . We could take the collection of all subsets of and call that . Or even the power set of that set of sets of sets.    Another way to compare sets is by their size . Notice that in the example above, has 6 elements and , , and all have 3 elements. The size of a set is called the set's cardinality . cardinality We would write , , and so on. For sets that have a finite number of elements, the cardinality of the set is simply the number of elements in the set. Note that the cardinality of is 3. We do not count repeats (in fact, is exactly the same set as ). There are sets with infinite cardinality, such as , the set of rational numbers (written ), the set of even natural numbers, and the set of real numbers ( ). It is possible to distinguish between different infinite cardinalities, but that is beyond the scope of this text. For us, a set will either be infinite, or finite; if it is finite, the we can determine its cardinality by counting elements.       Find the cardinality of .    Find the cardinality of .    If , what is the cardinality of ?          Since , we can conclude that the cardinality of the set is (you need to add one since 23 is included).    Here . The three elements are the number 1, the set , and the empty set.    We wrote out the elements of the power set above, and there are 8 elements (each of which is a set). So . (You might wonder if there is a relationship between and for all sets . This is a good question which we will return to in .)         Operations On Sets  set operations  operations on sets  Is it possible to add two sets? Not really, however there is something similar. If we want to combine two sets to get the collection of objects that are in either set, then we can take the union  union of sets of the two sets. Symbolically, , read, is the union of and , means that the elements of are exactly the elements which are either an element of or an element of (or an element of both). For example, if and , then .  The other common operation on sets is intersection . intersection of sets We write, and say, is the intersection of and , when the elements in are precisely those both in and in . So if and , then .  Often when dealing with sets, we will have some understanding as to what everything is. Perhaps we are only concerned with natural numbers. In this case we would say that our universe is . universe set Sometimes we denote this universe by . Given this context, we might wish to speak of all the elements which are not in a particular set. We say is the complement  complement of a set of , and write, when contains every element not contained in . So, if our universe is , and , then .  Of course we can perform more than one operation at a time. For example, consider .  This is the set of all elements which are both elements of and not elements of . What have we done? We've started with and removed all of the elements which were in . Another way to write this is the set difference : set difference  difference of sets  .  It is important to remember that these operations (union, intersection, complement, and difference) on sets produce other sets. Don't confuse these with the symbols from the previous section (element of and subset of). is a set, while is true or false. This is the same difference as between (which is a number) and (which is false).    Let , , and . If the universe is , find:  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .         since everything in is already in .   since everything in is in .   as the only element of both and is 2.   since and have no common elements.   . First we find that , then we take everything not in that set.   since the elements 1, 3, and 5 are in but not in . This is the same as .   . The set contains all elements that are either in but not in (i.e., ), or not in both and (i.e., ).   since nothing is added by the empty set.   since nothing can be both in a set and in the empty set.      Having notation like this is useful. We will often want to add or remove elements from sets, and our notation allows us to do so precisely.    If , then we can describe the set we get by adding the number 4 as . If we want to express the set we get by removing the number 2 from we can do so by writing .  Careful though. If you add an element to the set, you get a new set! So you would have and then correctly say that contains 4, but does not.    There is one more way to combine sets which will be useful for us: the Cartesian product , Cartesian product  .   the Cartesian product of and  This sounds fancy but is nothing you haven't seen before. When you graph a function in calculus, you graph it in the Cartesian plane. This is the set of all ordered pairs of real numbers . We can do this for any pair of sets, not just the real numbers with themselves.  Put another way, . The first coordinate comes from the first set and the second coordinate comes from the second set. Sometimes we will want to take the Cartesian product of a set with itself, and this is fine: (we might also write for this set). Notice that in , we still want all ordered pairs, not just the ones where the first and second coordinate are the same. We can also take products of 3 or more sets, getting ordered triples, or quadruples, and so on.    Let and . Find and . How many elements do you expect to be in ?     .   .   . There will be 3 pairs with first coordinate , three more with first coordinate , and a final three with first coordinate .      Venn Diagrams  Venn diagram  set Venn diagram   Venn diagram There is a very nice visual tool we can use to represent operations on sets. A Venn diagram displays sets as intersecting circles. We can shade the region we are talking about when we carry out an operation. We can also represent cardinality of a particular set by putting the number in the corresponding region.      Two overlapping circles enclosed in a rectangular box. Circles labeled A and B.       Three overlapping circles enclosed in a rectangle. The circle labeled A is in the top left, the circle labeled B is in the top right, the circle labeled C is in the bottom center. The circles intersect to create seven interior regions: one inside all circles, three inside just a pair of circles, and three inside only one circle.     Each circle represents a set. The rectangle containing the circles represents the universe. To represent combinations of these sets, we shade the corresponding region. For example, we could draw as: Venn diagram intersection      Two overlapping circles enclosed in a rectangular box. Circles labeled A and B. The overlapping region inside both circles is shaded light gray.    Here is a representation of , or equivalently :  Venn diagram  set difference       Two overlapping circles enclosed in a rectangular box. Circles labeled A and B. The region inside circle A but outside circle B is shaded light gray.    A more complicated example is , as seen below.     Three overlapping circles enclosed in a rectangle. The circle labeled A is in the top left, the circle labeled B is in the top right, the circle labeled C is in the bottom center. The circles intersect to create seven interior regions: one inside all circles, three inside just a pair of circles, and three inside only one circle. Three of the seven regions are shaded light gray: the region in C alone, the region in just C and B, and the center region in all three circles.    Notice that the shaded regions above could also be arrived at in another way. We could have started with all of , then excluded the region where and overlap outside of . That region is . So the above Venn diagram also represents . So using just the picture, we have determined that .       Find each of the following sets.  Your answers should include the curly braces                                       It includes everything that is in or or both.    It contains everything that is in both and    It contains everything that is in except anything that is also in We could also have written this set as    It contains everything in except anything that is also in Another way to write this is Note that           Find the least element of each of the following sets, if there is one.  If there is no least element, enter none .     .                                       This is the set since we need each element to be a natural number whose square is at least 3 more than 1. Since but we see that the first such natural number is 2.    We get the same set as we did in the previous part, and the smallest non-negative number for which is a natural number is 2.  Note that if we didn t specify by saying that then any integer less than would also be in the set, so there would not be a least element.    This is the set namely the set of numbers that are the result of squaring and adding 4 to a natural number. (   and so on.) Thus the least element of the set is 4.    Now we are looking for natural numbers that are equal to taking some natural number, squaring it and adding 4. That is, the same set as the previous part. So again, the least element is 4.

Find .   We are looking for a set containing 16 sets.    .     Let How many subsets of contain exactly one element (i.e., how many singleton subsets are there)?  How many doubleton subsets (containing exactly two elements) are there?   Write these out, or at least start to and look for a pattern.             Each of the 9 elements can be in a singleton set, so there are 9 of these.  To count the number of doubletons, not that there are 8 sets that include 1, and then 7 sets that include 2 and not 1, and then 6 that include 3 and not 1 or 2, and so on.

  "body": " Functions   This section contains many details about functions, much of which should be familiar from non-discrete contexts. As you read, consider how the way we talk about functions here might be different from what you know from other areas of mathematics.   function 330  domain   codomain   image of an element  A function is a rule that assigns each input exactly one output. We call the output the image of the input. The set of all inputs for a function is called the domain . The set of all allowable outputs is called the codomain . We would write to describe a function with name , domain and codomain . This does not tell us which function is though. To define the function, we must describe the rule. This is often done by giving a formula to compute the output for any input (although this is certainly not the only way to describe the rule).  For example, consider the function defined by . Here the domain and codomain are the same set (the natural numbers). The rule is: take your input, multiply it by itself and add 3. This works because we can apply this rule to every natural number (every element of the domain) and the result is always a natural number (an element of the codomain). Notice though that not every natural number is actually an output (there is no way to get 0, 1, 2, 5, etc.). The set of natural numbers that are outputs is called the range  range of a function  of the function (in this case, the range is , all the natural numbers that are 3 more than a perfect square).  The key thing that makes a rule a function is that there is exactly one output for each input. That is, it is important that the rule be a good rule. What output do we assign to the input 7? There can only be one answer for any particular function.    The following are all examples of functions:    defined by . The domain and codomain are both the set of integers. However, the range is only the set of integer multiples of 3.     defined by , and . The domain is the set , the codomain is the set and the range is the set . Note that and are the same element of the codomain. This is okay since each element in the domain still has only one output.     defined by the table:       1  2  3  4      3  6  9  12     Here the domain is the finite set and to codomain is the set of natural numbers, . At first you might think this function is the same as defined above. It is absolutely not. Even though the rule is the same, the domain and codomain are different, so these are two different functions.         Just because you can describe a rule in the same way you would write a function, does not mean that the rule is a function. The following are NOT functions.    defined by . The reason this is not a function is because not every input has an output. Where does send 3? The rule says that , but is not an element of the codomain.    Consider the rule that matches each person to their phone number. If you think of the set of people as the domain and the set of phone numbers as the codomain, then this is not a function, since some people have two phone numbers. Switching the domain and codomain sets doesn't help either, since some phone numbers belong to multiple people (assuming some households still have landlines when you are reading this).         Describing Functions  function how to describe   It is worth making a distinction between a function and its description. The function is the abstract mathematical object that in some way exists whether or not anyone ever talks about it. But when we do want to talk about the function, we need a way to describe it. A particular function can be described in multiple ways.   rule of four   Some calculus textbooks talk about the Rule of Four , that every function can be described in four ways: algebraically (a formula), numerically (a table), graphically, or in words. In discrete math, we can still use any of these to describe functions, but we can also be more specific since we are primarily concerned with functions that have or a finite subset of as their domain.   graph (of a function)  Describing a function graphically usually means drawing the graph of the function: plotting the points on the plane. We can do this, and might get a graph like the following for a function .     Graph of the first quadrant, including axes and a rectangular grid. Points on grid at (1,2), (2, 1) and (3,3).    It would be absolutely WRONG to connect the dots or try to fit them to some curve. There are only three elements in the domain. A curve would mean that the domain contains an entire interval of real numbers.  Here is another way to represent that same function:     Two rows containing the numbers 1, 2, and 3, from left to right. Arrows from the top 1 to bottom 2, from the top 2 to bottom 1, and top 3 straight down to bottom 3.    This shows that the function sends 1 to 2, 2 to 1 and 3 to 3: just follow the arrows.  The arrow diagram used to define the function above can be very helpful in visualizing functions. We will often be working with functions with finite domains, so this kind of picture is often more useful than a traditional graph of a function.  Note that for finite domains, finding an algebraic formula that gives the output for any input is often impossible. Of course we could use a piecewise defined function, like . This describes exactly the same function as above, but we can all agree is a ridiculous way of doing so.  Since we will so often use functions with small domains and codomains, let's adopt some notation to describe them. All we need is some clear way of denoting the image of each element in the domain. In fact, writing a table of values would work perfectly:       0  1  2  3  4      3  3  2  4  1      two-line notation   function two-line notation  We simplify this further by writing this as a matrix with each input directly over its output: . Note this is just notation and not the same sort of matrix you would find in a linear algebra class (it does not make sense to do operations with these matrices, or row reduce them, for example).  One advantage of the two-line notation over the arrow diagrams is that it is harder to accidentally define a rule that is not a function using two-line notation.    Which of the following diagrams represent a function? Let and .     Picture labeled f:X to Y with two rows of numbers and letters and arrows between the rows. Top row contains the numbers 1, 2, 3, and 4. Bottom row contains letters a, b, c, and d. Arrows point from 1 to d, 2 to a, 3 to c, and 4 to d.     Picture labeled g:X to Y with two rows of numbers and letters and arrows between the rows. Top row contains the numbers 1, 2, 3, and 4. Bottom row contains letters a, b, c, and d. Arrows point from 1 to d, 2 to a, 3 to a, and 4 to b.     Picture labeled f:X to Y with two rows of numbers and letters and arrows between the rows. Top row contains the numbers 1, 2, 3, and 4. Bottom row contains letters a, b, c, and d. Arrows point from 2 to a and also 2 to c, 3 to d, and 4 to b.       is a function. So is . There is no problem with an element of the codomain not being the image of any input, and there is no problem with from the codomain being the image of both 2 and 3 from the domain. We could use our two-line notation to write these as .  However, is NOT a function. In fact, it fails for two reasons. First, the element 1 from the domain has not been mapped to any element from the codomain. Second, the element 2 from the domain has been mapped to more than one element from the codomain ( and ). Note that either one of these problems is enough to make a rule not a function. In general, neither of the following mappings are functions:     Three black dots in a row above and two white dots in a row below. An arrow points from the left black dot to the left white dot and from the right black dot to the right white dot.     Three black dots in a row above and four white dots in a row below. Two arrows point from the left black dot to each of the two left-most white dots. Each of the other black dots have an arrow pointing down to the white dots below and slightly to the right of them.    It might also be helpful to think about how you would write the two-line notation for . We would have something like: . There is nothing under 1 (bad) and we needed to put more than one thing under 2 (very bad). With a rule that is actually a function, the two-line notation will always work .    We will also be interested in functions with domain . Here two-line notation is no good, but describing the function algebraically is often possible. Even tables are a little awkward, since they do not describe the function completely. For example, consider the function given by the table below.       0  1  2  3  4  5        0  1  4  9  16  25       Have I given you enough entries for you to be able to determine ? You might guess that , but there is no way for you to know this for sure. Maybe I am being a jerk and intended . In fact, for every natural number , there is a function that agrees with the table above, but for which .  Okay, suppose I really did mean for , and in fact, for the rule that you think is governing the function to actually be the rule. Then I should say what that rule is. . Now there is no confusion possible.  Giving an explicit formula that calculates the image of any element in the domain is a great way to describe a function. We will say that these explicit rules are closed formulas for the function. closed formula for a function    There is another very useful way to describe functions whose domain is , that rely specifically on the structure of the natural numbers. We can define a function recursively !    Consider the function given by and . Find .    The rule says that (we are using so ). We don't know what is though. Well, we know that . So we need to compute , which will require knowing , which will require , will it ever end?  Yes! In fact, this process will always end because we have as our domain, so there is a least element. And we gave the value of explicitly, so we are good. In fact, we might decide to work up to instead of working down from :   It looks that this recursively defined function is the same as the explicitly defined function . Is it? Later we will prove that it is.    Recursively defined functions are often easier to create from a real world problem, because they describe how the values of the functions are changing. However, this comes with a price. It is harder to calculate the image of a single input, since you need to know the images of other (previous) elements in the domain.   Recursively Defined Functions  recursively defined function    initial condition for a function   recurrence relation for a function  For a function , a recursive definition consists of an initial condition together with a recurrence relation . The initial condition is the explicitly given value of . The recurrence relation is a formula for in terms for (and possibly itself).     Give recursive definitions for the functions described below.    gives the number of snails in your terrarium years after you built it, assuming you started with 3 snails and the number of snails doubles each year.     gives the number of push-ups you do days after you started your push-ups challenge, assuming you could do 7 push-ups on day 0 and you can do 2 more push-ups each day.     defined by . Recall that is the product of all numbers from through . We also define .          The initial condition is . To get we would double the number of snails in the terrarium the previous year, which is given by . Thus . The full recursive definition contains both of these, and would be written, .    We are told that on day 0 you can do 7 push-ups, so . The number of push-ups you can do on day is 2 more than the number you can do on day , which is given by . Thus .    Here . To get the recurrence relation, think about how you can get from . If you write out both of these as products, you see that is just like except you have one more term in the product, an extra . So we have, .         Surjections, Injections, and Bijections  surjection   injection   bijection   We now turn to investigating special properties functions might or might not possess.  In the examples above, you may have noticed that sometimes there are elements of the codomain which are not in the range. When this sort of the thing does not happen, (that is, when everything in the codomain is in the range) we say the function is onto  onto function surjection  or that the function maps the domain onto the codomain. This terminology should make sense: the function puts the domain (entirely) on top of the codomain. The fancy math term for an onto function is a surjection , surjection  and we say that an onto function is a surjective function.  In pictures:     Four black dots in a top row and three white dots in a bottom row. Arrows point from the top dots to the bottom dots below them: the two white dots on the left have one arrow each point to them. The right-most white dot has two arrows pointing to it, coming from two different black dots. The image is labeled with the word \"Surjective\"      Four black dots in a top row and three white dots in a bottom row. Arrows point from the top dots to the bottom dots below them: the two white dots on the left and right have two arrows each pointing to them. The center white dot has no arrows pointing to it. The image is labeled with the words \"Not surjective\"       Which functions are surjective (i.e., onto)?  defined by .   defined by .    defined as follows:     Two rows containing the numbers 1, 2, and 3, from left to right. Arrows from the top 1 to bottom 2, from the top 2 to bottom 1, and top 3 straight down to bottom 3.            is not surjective. There are elements in the codomain which are not in the range. For example, no gets mapped to the number 1 (the rule would say that would be sent to 1, but is not in the domain). In fact, the range of the function is (the integer multiples of 3), which is not equal to .   is not surjective. There is no (the domain) for which , so , which is in the codomain, is not in the range. Notice that there is an element from the codomain missing from the bottom row of the matrix.   is surjective. Every element of the codomain is also in the range. Nothing in the codomain is missed.      To be a function, a rule cannot assign a single element of the domain to two or more different elements of the codomain. However, we have seen that the reverse is permissible: a function might assign the same element of the codomain to two or more different elements of the domain. When this does not occur (that is, when each element of the codomain is the image of at most one element of the domain) then we say the function is one-to-one . one-to-one function injection  Again, this terminology makes sense: we are sending at most one element from the domain to one element from the codomain. One input to one output. The fancy math term for a one-to-one function is an injection . injection  We call one-to-one functions injective functions.  In pictures:     Four black dots in a top row and five white dots in a bottom row. Arrows point from the top dots to the bottom dots below them. Each black dot has an arrow pointing to a different white dot. The center white dot has no arrow pointing to it. The image is labeled with the word \"Injective\"      Four black dots in a top row and five white dots in a bottom row. Arrows point from the top dots to the bottom dots below them. Two of the black dots have an arrow pointing to a different white dot. The other two black dots have arrows pointing to the same white dot. Two white dots have no arrows pointing to them. The image is labeled with the words \"Not injective\"       Which functions are injective (i.e., one-to-one)?  defined by .   defined by .    defined as follows:    Two rows containing the numbers 1, 2, and 3, from left to right. Arrows from the top 1 to bottom 2, from the top 2 to bottom 1, and top 3 straight down to bottom 3.           is injective. Each element in the codomain is assigned to at most one element from the domain. If is a multiple of three, then only is mapped to . If is not a multiple of 3, then there is no input corresponding to the output .   is not injective. Both inputs and are assigned the output . Notice that there is an element from the codomain that appears more than once on the bottom row of the matrix.   is injective. Each output is only an output once.      Be careful: surjective and injective are NOT opposites. You can see in the two examples above that there are functions which are surjective but not injective, injective but not surjective, both, or neither. In the case when a function is both one-to-one and onto (an injection and surjection), we say the function is a bijection , bijection  or that the function is a bijective function.  To illustrate the contrast between these two properties, consider a more formal definition of each, side by side.   Injective vs Surjective  A function is injective provided every element of the codomain is the image of at most one element from the domain.  A function is surjective provided every element of the codomain is the image of at least one element from the domain.   Notice both properties are determined by what happens to elements of the codomain: they could be repeated as images or they could be missed (not be images). Injective functions do not have repeats but might or might not miss elements. Surjective functions do not miss elements, but might or might not have repeats. The bijective functions are those that do not have repeats and do not miss elements.     Image and Inverse Image  image   inverse image   When discussing functions, we have notation for talking about an element of the domain (say ) and its corresponding element in the codomain (we write , which is the image of ). Sometimes we will want to talk about all the elements that are images of some subset of the domain. It would also be nice to start with some element of the codomain (say ) and talk about which element or elements (if any) from the domain it is the image of. We could write those in the domain such that , but this is a lot of writing. Here is some notation to make our lives easier.   image of a set  To address the first situation, what we are after is a way to describe the set of images of elements in some subset of the domain. Suppose is a function and that is some subset of the domain (possibly all of it). We will use the notation to denote the image of under , namely the set of elements in that are the image of elements from . That is, .    the image of under .     inverse image   complete inverse image  We can do this in the other direction as well. We might ask which elements of the domain get mapped to a particular set in the codomain. Let be a function and suppose is a subset of the codomain. Then we will write for the inverse image of under , namely the set of elements in whose image are elements in . In other words, .    the inverse image of under .    Often we are interested in the element(s) whose image is a particular element of in the codomain. The notation above works: is the set of all elements in the domain that sends to . It makes sense to think of this as a set: there might not be anything sent to (if is not in the range), in which case . Or might send multiple elements to (if is not injective). As a notational convenience, we usually drop the set braces around the and write instead for this set.   inverse image comparison to inverse function  WARNING: is not an inverse function! Inverse functions only exist for bijections, but is defined for any function . The point: is a set , not an element of the domain. This is just sloppy notation for . To help make this distinction, we would call the complete inverse image of under . It is not the image of under (since the function might not exist).    Consider the function given by . Find , , and .     since and are the elements in the codomain to which sends , , and .   since these are exactly the elements that sends to and .   since is not in the range of .      Consider the function defined by . Find and . Then find , , and .    Note that . The first is an element: . The second is a set: .  To find , we need to find all integers such that . Clearly only 0 works, so (note that even though there is only one element, we still write it as a set with one element in it).  To find , we need to find all such that . We see .  Finally, if , then we are looking for an such that . There are no such integers so .    Since is a set, it makes sense to ask for , the number of elements in the domain which map to .    Find a function such that .    There is only one such function. We need five elements of the domain to map to the number . Since there are only five elements in the domain, all of them must map to 7. So .     Function Definitions  Here is a summary of all the main concepts and definitions we use when working with functions.    function   domain   codomain  A function is a rule that assigns each element of a set, called the domain , to exactly one element of a second set, called the codomain .     function notation  Notation: is our way of saying that the function is called , the domain is the set , and the codomain is the set .     two-line notation   function two-line notation  To specify the rule for a function with small domain, use two-line notation by writing a matrix with each output directly below its corresponding input, as in: .     image of an element   means the element of the domain (input) is assigned to the element of the codomain. We say is an output. Alternatively, we call the image of under .     range of a function  The range is a subset of the codomain. It is the set of all elements which are assigned to at least one element of the domain by the function. That is, the range is the set of all outputs.     injection  A function is injective (an injection or one-to-one ) if every element of the codomain is the image of at most one element from the domain.     surjection  A function is surjective (a surjection or onto ) if every element of the codomain is the image of at least one element from the domain.     bijection  A bijection is a function which is both an injection and surjection. In other words, if every element of the codomain is the image of exactly one element from the domain.     image of an element  The image of an element in the domain is the element in the codomain that is mapped to. That is, the image of under is .     inverse image   complete inverse image  The complete inverse image of an element in the codomain, written , is the set of all elements in the domain which are assigned to by the function.     image of a subset  The image of a subset of the domain is the set .     inverse image of a subset  The inverse image of a subset of the codomain is the set .        Explain, in your own words, the relationship between the codomain of a function and the range of a function.    If a function has domain and codomain of equal sizes, must the function be surjective ? Must it be injective ? Could it be only one of these? Briefly explain your thinking.         Consider the function given by       Find .    Find a in the domain such that     Find an element of the domain such that     Find an element of the codomain that is not in the range.                           since 1 is the number below 2 in the two-line notation.    Such an is since Note that 4 is above a 2 in the notation.    has this property. We say that 5 is a fixed point of Not all functions have such a point.    Such an element is 4 (in fact, that is the only element in the codomain that is not in the range). In other words, 4 is not the image of any element under nothing is sent to 4.           The following functions all have as both their domain and codomain. For each, determine whether it is (only) injective, (only) surjective, bijective, or neither injective nor surjective.                 Since the domain and codomain are the same size, is it possible for a function to be injective but not surjective, or surjective but not injective?         Consider the following functions . For each, determine whether it is (only) injective, (only) surjective, bijective, or neither injective nor surjective.                    Consider the following functions . For each, determine whether it is (only) injective, (only) surjective, bijective, or neither injective nor surjective.                    Write out all functions (using two-line notation).  How many functions are there?  How many are surjective?  How many are injective?  How many are bijective?                       There are 16 different functions. None of the functions are injective. Exactly 14 of the functions are surjective (there are 2 that are not: send everything to or everything to . No functions are both (since no functions here are injective).         Write out all functions (in two-line notation).  How many functions are there?  How many are surjective?  How many are injective?  How many are bijective?                       There are 16 functions: you have a choice of four outputs for and for each, you have four choices for the output Of these functions, 12 are injective, 0 are surjective, and 0 are both (i.e., bijective):              Consider the function given by the table below:       1  2  3  4  5      3  2  4  1  2        Is injective? Explain.    Is surjective? Explain.    Write the function using two-line notation.          is not injective, since ; two different inputs have the same output.     is surjective, since every element of the codomain is an element of the range.     .       Consider the function given by the graph below.     The first quadrant of a coordinate plane. Horizontal axis labeled \"x\", vertical axis labeled \"f(x)\". Both axes labeled with the numbers 1 through 4, with an integer grid. Points at (1,3), (2,4), (3,1) and (4, 3).       Is injective? Explain.    Is surjective? Explain.    Write the function using two-line notation.        Consider the function given recursively by and Find        To find we need to know for which we need and so on. So build up from Then   .... In fact, it looks like a closed formula for is Later we will see how to prove this is correct.         Suppose satisfies the recurrence Note that this is not enough information to define the function, since we don t have an initial condition. For each of the initial conditions below, find the value of                                             For each case, you must use the recurrence to find  ... But notice each time you just add 6 to the previous. We do this 5 times.                     Suppose satisfies the recurrence relation . Note that with the initial condition , the values of the function are: , , , , and so on, the images cycling through those three numbers. Thus is NOT injective (and also certainly not surjective). Might it be under other initial conditions? It turns out this is a really hard question to answer in general. The Collatz conjecture is that no matter what the initial condition is, the function will eventually produce 1 as an output. This is an open problem in mathematics: nobody knows the answer.   If satisfies the initial condition , is injective? Explain why or give a specific example of two elements from the domain with the same image.    If satisfies the initial condition , is injective? Explain why or give a specific example of two elements from the domain with the same image.    If satisfies the initial condition , then it turns out that and no two numbers less than 105 have the same image. Could be injective? Explain.    Prove that no matter what initial condition you choose, the function cannot be surjective.       For each function given below, determine whether or not the function is injective and whether or not the function is surjective.  given by .  given by .  given by .   given by         is injective, but not surjective (since 0, for example, is never an output).   is injective and surjective. Unlike in the previous question, every integers is an output (of the integer 4 less than it).   is injective, but not surjective (10 is not 8 less than a multiple of 5, for example).   is not injective, but is surjective. Every integer is an output (of twice itself, for example) but some integers are outputs of more than one input: .      Let . Consider the function given by . That is, takes a subset of as an input and outputs the cardinality of that set.   Is injective? Prove your answer.    Is surjective? Prove your answer.    Find .    Find .    Find .          is not injective. To prove this, we must simply find two different elements of the domain which map to the same element of the codomain. Since and , we see that is not injective.     is not surjective. The largest subset of is itself, and . So no natural number greater than 10 will ever be an output.     (the set of all the singleton subsets of ).     . Note, it would be wrong to write - that would claim that there is no input which has 0 as an output.     , since there are no subsets of with cardinality 12.        Let be the set of all numbers with three or fewer digits. Define the function by where  and are the digits of the number in (write numbers less than 100 with leading 0 s to make them three digits). In other words, returns the sum of the digits of its input. For example,    Let Find    Find    Find    Find                              Consider the set , the set of all ordered pairs where and are natural numbers. Consider a function given by .   Let .

Explain.     is surjective? Explain.     is bijective? Explain.          . In other words, either is the empty set or is a set containing exactly one element. Injective functions cannot have two elements from the domain both map to 3.     . In other words, is a set containing at least one elements, possibly more. Surjective functions must have something map to 3.     . There is exactly one element from which gets mapped to 3, so is the set containing that one element.       Find a set and a function so that .    can really be any set, as long as or for every . For example, and works.

Let and be functions. We can define the composition  composition of functions  of and to be the function for which the image of each is . That is, plug into , then plug the result into (just like composition in algebra and calculus).   If and are both injective, must be injective? Explain.    If and are both surjective, must be surjective? Explain.    Suppose is injective. What, if anything, can you say about and ? Explain.    Suppose is surjective. What, if anything, can you say about and ? Explain.      Work with some examples. What if and ?    Consider the function given by    Is injective? Prove your answer.    Is surjective? Prove your answer.          is injective.   Let and be elements of the domain . Assume . If and are both even, then and . Since , we have which implies that . Similarly, if and are both odd, then so again . The only other possibility is that is even an is odd (or visa-versa). But then would be odd and would be even, so it cannot be that . Therefore if we then have , which proves that is injective.      is surjective.   Let be an element of the codomain . We will show there is an element of the domain ( ) such that . There are two cases: First, if is even, then let . Since is even, is odd, so as desired. Second, if is odd, then let . Since is odd, is even, so as needed. Therefore is surjective.        At the end of the semester a teacher assigns letter grades to each of her students. Is this a function? If so, what sets make up the domain and codomain, and is the function injective, surjective, bijective, or neither?   Yes, this is a function, if you choose the domain and codomain correctly. The domain will be the set of students, and the codomain will be the set of possible grades. The function is almost certainly not injective, because it is likely that two students will get the same grade. The function might be surjective it will be if there is at least one student who gets each grade.    In the game of Hearts , four players are each dealt 13 cards from a deck of 52. Is this a function? If so, what sets make up the domain and codomain, and is the function injective, surjective, bijective, or neither?    Seven players are playing 5-card stud. Each player initially receives 5 cards from a deck of 52. Is this a function? If so, what sets make up the domain and codomain, and is the function injective, surjective, bijective, or neither?   This is not a function.    Consider the function that gives the number of handshakes that take place in a room of people assuming everyone shakes hands with everyone else. Give a recursive definition for this function.   To find the recurrence relation, consider how many new handshakes occur when person enters the room.   The recurrence relation is .

  "title": "Generating Functions",
  "body": " Generating Functions  generating function   There is an extremely powerful tool in discrete mathematics used to manipulate sequences called the generating function. The idea is this: instead of an infinite sequence (for example: ) we look at a single function which encodes the sequence. But not a function which gives the th term as output. Instead, a function whose power series (like from calculus) displays the terms of the sequence. So for example, we would look at the power series which displays the sequence as coefficients.  An infinite power series is simply an infinite sum of terms of the form were is some constant. So we might write a power series like this: . or expanded like this .  When viewed in the context of generating functions, we call such a power series a generating series . The generating series generates the sequence .  In other words, the sequence generated by a generating series is simply the sequence of coefficients of the infinite polynomial.    What sequence is represented by the generating series ?    We just read off the coefficients of each term. So since the coefficient of is 3 ( so this is the constant term). What is ? It is NOT 8, since 8 is the coefficient of , so 8 is the term of the sequence. To find we need to look for the coefficient of which in this case is 0. So . Continuing, we have , , , and . So we have the sequence .  Note that when discussing generating functions, we always start our sequence with .    Now you might very naturally ask why we would do such a thing. One reason is that encoding a sequence with a power series helps us keep track of which term is which in the sequence. For example, if we write the sequence it is impossible to determine which term is (even if we agreed that the first term was supposed to be ). However, if we wrote the generating series instead, we would have . Now it is clear that 24 is the 17th term of the sequence (that is, ). Of course to get this benefit we could have displayed our sequence in any number of ways, perhaps , but we do not do this. The reason is that the generating series looks like an ordinary power series (although we are interpreting it differently) so we can do things with it that we ordinarily do with power series such as write down what it converges to.  For example, from calculus we know that the power series converges to the function . So we can use as a way of talking about the sequence of coefficients of the power series for . When we write down a nice compact function which has an infinite power series that we view as a generating series, then we call that function a generating function . In this example, we would say .    Building Generating Functions  The example is very specific. We have a rather odd sequence, and the only reason we know its generating function is because we happen to know the Taylor series for . Our goal now is to gather some tools to build the generating function of a particular given sequence.  Let's see what the generating functions are for some very simple sequences. The simplest of all: 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, . What does the generating series look like? It is simply . Now, can we find a closed formula for this power series? Yes! This particular series is really just a geometric series with common ratio . So if we use our multiply, shift and subtract technique from , we have   Therefore we see that .  You might remember from calculus that this is only true on the interval of convergence for the power series, in this case when . That is true for us, but we don't care. We are never going to plug anything in for , so as long as there is some value of for which the generating function and generating series agree, we are happy. And in this case we are happy.    The generating function for is    Let's use this basic generating function to find generating functions for more sequences. What if we replace by . We get .  If we replace by we get .  By replacing the in we can get generating functions for a variety of sequences, but not all. For example, you cannot plug in anything for to get the generating function for . However, we are not lost yet. Notice that each term of is the result of multiplying the terms of by the constant 2. So multiply the generating function by 2 as well. .  Similarly, to find the generating function for the sequence , we note that this sequence is the result of multiplying each term of by 3. Since we have the generating function for we can say .  What about the sequence ? Here the terms are always 1 more than powers of 3. That is, we have added the sequences and term by term. Therefore we can get a generating function by adding the respective generating functions:   The fun does not stop there: if we replace in our original generating function by we get .  How could we get ? Start with the previous sequence and shift it over by 1. But how do you do this? To see how shifting works, let's first try to get the generating function for the sequence . We know that . To get the zero out front, we need the generating series to look like (so there is no constant term). Multiplying by has this effect. So the generating function for is . This will also work to get the generating function for : .  What if we add the sequences and term by term? We should get . What happens when we add the generating functions? It works (try it)! .  Here's a sneaky one: what happens if you take the derivative of ? We get . On the other hand, if we differentiate term by term in the power series, we get which is the generating series for . This says    The generating function for is .   Take a second derivative: . So is a generating function for the triangular numbers, (although here we have while usually).    generating function differencing  Differencing  We have seen how to find generating functions from using multiplication (by a constant or by ), substitution, addition, and differentiation. To use each of these, you must notice a way to transform the sequence into your desired sequence. This is not always easy. It is also not really the way we have analyzed sequences. One thing we have considered often is the sequence of differences between terms of a sequence. This will turn out to be helpful in finding generating functions as well. The sequence of differences is often simpler than the original sequence. So if we know a generating function for the differences, we would like to use this to find a generating function for the original sequence.  For example, consider the sequence . How could we move to the sequence of first differences: ? We want to subtract 2 from the 4, 4 from the 10, 10 from the 28, and so on. So if we subtract (term by term) the sequence from , we will be set. We can get the generating function for from the generating function for by multiplying by . Use to represent the generating function for Then:   While we don't get exactly the sequence of differences, we do get something close. In this particular case, we already know the generating function (we found it in the previous section) but most of the time we will use this differencing technique to find  : if we have the generating function for the sequence of differences, we can then solve for .    Find a generating function for .    Notice that the sequence of differences is constant. We know how to find the generating function for any constant sequence. So denote the generating function for by . We have   We know that . Thus .  Now solve for : .  Does this makes sense? Before we simplified the two fractions into one, we were adding the generating function for the sequence to the generating function for the sequence (remember generates , multiplying by shifts it over, putting the zero out front, and doubles each term). If we add these term by term, we get the correct sequence .    Now that we have a generating function for the odd numbers, we can use that to find the generating function for the squares:    Find the generating function for . Note we take .    Again we call the generating function for the sequence . Using differencing:   Since we have .    In each of the examples above, we found the difference between consecutive terms which gave us a sequence of differences for which we knew a generating function. We can generalize this to more complicated relationships between terms of the sequence. For example, if we know that the sequence satisfies the recurrence relation ? In other words, if we take a term of the sequence and subtract 3 times the previous term and then add 2 times the term before that, we get 0 (since ). That will hold for all but the first two terms of the sequence. So after the first two terms, the sequence of results of these calculations would be a sequence of 0's, for which we definitely know a generating function.    The sequence satisfies the recurrence relation . Find the generating function for the sequence.    Call the generating function for the sequence . We have   We multiplied by which shifts every term over one spot and multiplies them by . On the third line, we multiplied by , which shifted every term over two spots and multiplied them by 2. When we add up the corresponding terms, we are taking each term, subtracting 3 times the previous term, and adding 2 times the term before that. This will happen for each term after because . In general, we might have two terms from the beginning of the generating series, although in this case the second term happens to be 0 as well.  Now we just need to solve for : .       generating function  multiplication and partial sums   Multiplication and Partial Sums  What happens to the sequences when you multiply two generating functions? Let's see: and . To multiply and , we need to do a lot of distributing (infinite FOIL?) but keep in mind we will group like terms and only need to write down the first few terms to see the pattern. The constant term is . The coefficient of is . And so on. We get: .     Multiply the sequence by the sequence .    The new constant term is just . The next term will be . The next term: . One more: . The resulting sequence is .  Since the generating function for is and the generating function for is , we have that the generating function for is     Consider the special case when you multiply a sequence by . For example, multiply by . The first term is . Then . Then . The next term will be 10. We are getting the triangular numbers. More precisely, we get the sequence of partial sums of . In terms of generating functions, we take (generating ) and multiply it by (generating ) and this give . This should not be a surprise as we found the same generating function for the triangular numbers earlier.  The point is, if you need to find a generating function for the sum of the first terms of a particular sequence, and you know the generating function for that sequence, you can multiply it by . To go back from the sequence of partial sums to the original sequence, you look at the sequence of differences. When you get the sequence of differences you end up multiplying by , or equivalently, dividing by . Multiplying by gives partial sums, dividing by gives differences.    Solving Recurrence Relations with Generating Functions   generating function  recurrence relation   recurrence relation generating function  We conclude with an example of one of the many reasons studying generating functions is helpful. We can use generating functions to solve recurrence relations.    Solve the recurrence relation with initial conditions and .    We saw in an example above that this recurrence relation gives the sequence which has generating function . We did this by calling the generating function and then computing which was just 1, since every other term canceled out.  But how does knowing the generating function help us? First, break up the generating function into two simpler ones. For this, we can use partial fraction decomposition. Start by factoring the denominator: .  Partial fraction decomposition tells us that we can write this faction as the sum of two fractions (we decompose the given fraction): .  To find and we add the two decomposed fractions using a common denominator. This gives . so .  This must be true for all values of . If , then the equation becomes so . When we get so . This tells us that we can decompose the fraction like this: .  This completes the partial fraction decomposition. Notice that these two fractions are generating functions we know. In fact, we should be able to expand each of them. . .  We can give a closed formula for the th term of each of these sequences. The first is just . The second is . The sequence we are interested in is just the sum of these, so the solution to the recurrence relation is .

  "body": " Introduction to Number Theory  number theory   We have used the natural numbers to solve problems. This was the right set of numbers to work with in discrete mathematics because we always dealt with a whole number of things. The natural numbers have been a tool. Let's take a moment now to inspect that tool. What mathematical discoveries can we make about the natural numbers themselves?  This is the main question of number theory: a huge, ancient, complex, and above all, beautiful branch of mathematics. Historically, number theory was known as the Queen of Mathematics and was very much a branch of pure mathematics, studied for its own sake instead of as a means to understanding real world applications. This has changed in recent years however, as applications of number theory have been unearthed. Probably the most well known example of this is RSA cryptography, one of the methods used in encrypt data on the internet. It is number theory that makes this possible.  What sorts of questions belong to the realm of number theory? Here is a motivating example. Recall in our study of induction, we asked:   Which amounts of postage can be made exactly using just 5-cent and 8-cent stamps?   We were able to prove that any amount greater than 27 cents could be made. You might wonder what would happen if we changed the denomination of the stamps. What if we instead had 4- and 9-cent stamps? Would there be some amount after which all amounts would be possible? Well, again, we could replace two 4-cent stamps with a 9-cent stamp, or three 9-cent stamps with seven 4-cent stamps. In each case we can create one more cent of postage. Using this as the inductive case would allow us to prove that any amount of postage greater than 23 cents can be made.  What if we had 2-cent and 4-cent stamps. Here it looks less promising. If we take some number of 2-cent stamps and some number of 4-cent stamps, what can we say about the total? Could it ever be odd? Doesn't look like it.   Why does 5 and 8 work, 4 and 9 work, but 2 and 4 not work? What is it about these numbers? If I gave you a pair of numbers, could you tell me right away if they would work or not? We will answer these questions, and more, after first investigating some simpler properties of numbers themselves.    divisibility relation  Divisibility  It is easy to add and multiply natural numbers. If we extend our focus to all integers, then subtraction is also easy (we need the negative numbers so we can subtract any number from any other number, even larger from smaller). Division is the first operation that presents a challenge. If we wanted to extend our set of numbers so any division would be possible (maybe excluding division by 0) we would need to look at the rational numbers (the set of all numbers which can be written as fractions). This would be going too far, so we will refuse this option.  In fact, it is a good thing that not every number can be divided by other numbers. This helps us understand the structure of the natural numbers and opens the door to many interesting questions and applications.  If given numbers and , it is possible that gives a whole number. In this case, we say that  divides  divides  , in symbols, we write . If this holds, then is a divisor or factor of , and is a multiple of . In other words, if , then for some integer (this is saying is some multiple of ).   The Divisibility Relation   divisibility relation  divides Given integers and , we say divides and write provided is an integer. Thus the following assertions mean the same thing:   for some integer   is a factor (or divisor) of   is a multiple of .     Notice that is a statement. It is either true or false. On the other hand, or is some number. If we want to claim that is not an integer, so does not divide , then we can write .    Decide whether each of the statements below are true or false.                  True. 4 goes into 20 five times without remainder. In other words, , an integer. We could also justify this by saying that is a multiple of 4: .    False. While 20 is a multiple of 4, it is false that is a multiple of 20.    False. is not even defined, let alone an integer.    True. In fact, is true for all . This is because 0 is a multiple of every number: .    True. In fact, is true for all .    True. 1 divides every number (other than 0).    True. Negative numbers work just fine for the divisibility relation. Here . It is also true that and that .    False. Both 8 and 12 are divisible by 4, but this does not mean that is divisible by .    False. See below.       This last example raises a question: how might one decide whether ? Of course, if you had a trusted calculator, you could ask it for the value of . If it spits out anything other than an integer, you know . This seems a little like cheating though: we don't have division, so should we really use division to check divisibility?  While we don't really know how to divide, we do know how to multiply. We might try multiplying by larger and larger numbers until we get close to . How close? Well, we want to be sure that if we multiply by the next larger integer, we go over .  For example, let's try this to decide whether . Start finding multiples of 1642: .  All of these are well less than 136299. I suppose we can jump ahead a bit: .  Ah, so we need to look somewhere between 80 and 85. Try 83: .  Is this the best we can do? How far are we from our desired 136299? If we subtract, we get . So we know we cannot go up to 84, that will be too much. In other words, we have found that .  Since , we can now safely say that .   division with remainder division algorithm  division algorithm It turns out that the process we went through above can be repeated for any pair of numbers. We can always write the number as some multiple of the number plus some remainder. We know this because we know about division with remainder from elementary school. This is just a way of saying it using multiplication. Due to the procedural nature that can be used to find the remainder, this fact is usually called the division algorithm :   The Division Algorithm   division algorithm Given any two integers and , we can always find an integer such that where is an integer satisfying    The idea is that we can always take a large enough multiple of so that the remainder is as small as possible. We do allow the possibility of , in which case we have .    Remainder Classes  remainder class  residue class remainder class  The division algorithm tells us that there are only possible remainders when dividing by . If we fix this divisor, we can group integers by the remainder. Each group is called a remainder class modulo (or sometimes residue class ).    Describe the remainder classes modulo .    We want to classify numbers by what their remainder would be when divided by . From the division algorithm, we know there will be exactly 5 remainder classes, because there are only 5 choices for what could be ( ).  First consider . Here we are looking for all the numbers divisible by since . In other words, the multiples of 5. We get the infinite set .  Notice we also include negative integers.  Next consider . Which integers, when divided by 5, have remainder 1? Well, certainly 1, does, as does 6, and 11. Negatives? Here we must be careful: does NOT have remainder 1. We can write or , but only one of these is a correct instance of the division algorithm: since we need to be non-negative. So in fact, to get , we would have , or , etc. Thus we get the remainder class .  There are three more to go. The remainder classes for , , and are, respectively   .     partition  equivalence relation Note that in the example above, every integer is in exactly one remainder class. The technical way to say this is that the remainder classes modulo form a partition of the integers. It is possible to develop a mathematical theory of partitions, prove statements about all partitions in general and then apply those observations to our case here. The most important fact about partitions, is that it is possible to define an equivalence relation from a partition: this is a relationship between pairs of numbers which acts in all the important ways like the equals relationship. Again, there is a mathematical theory of equivalence relations which applies in many more instances than the one we look at here.  All fun technical language aside, the idea is really simple. If two numbers belong to the same remainder class, then in some way, they are the same. That is, they are the same up to division by . In the case where above, the numbers and , while not the same number, are the same when it comes to dividing by 5, because both have remainder .  It matters what the divisor is: and are the same up to division by , but not up to division by , since has remainder of 1 when divided by 7 while 23 has a remainder of 2.  With all this in mind, let's introduce some notation. We want to say that and 23 are basically the same, even though they are not equal. It would be wrong to say . Instead, we write . But this is not always true. It works if we are thinking division by 5, so we need to denote that somehow. What we will actually write is this: which is read, 8 is congruent to 23 modulo 5 (or just mod 5 ). mod Of course then we could observe that .   Congruence Modulo  congruence  modulo  We say is congruent to modulo , and write, provided and have the same remainder when divided by . In other words, provided and belong to the same remainder class modulo .   Many books define congruence modulo slightly differently. They say that if and only if . In other words, two numbers are congruent modulo , if their difference is a multiple of . So which definition is correct? Turns out, it doesn't matter: they are equivalent.  To see why, consider two numbers and which are congruent modulo . Then and have the same remainder when divided by . We have .  Here the two 's really are the same. Consider what we get when we take the difference of and : .  So is a multiple of , or equivalently, .  On the other hand, if we assume first that , so , then consider what happens if we divide each term by . Dividing by will leave some remainder, as will dividing by . However, dividing by will leave 0 remainder. So the remainders on the left-hand side must cancel out. That is, the remainders must be the same.  Thus we have:   Congruence and Divisibility  congruence divisibility  divisibility  For any integers , , and , we have .   It will also be useful to switch back and forth between congruences and regular equations. The above fact helps with this. We know that if and only if , if and only if for some integer . Rearranging that equation, we get . In other words, if and are congruent modulo , then is more than some multiple of . This conforms with our earlier observation that all the numbers in a particular remainder class are the same amount larger than the multiples of .   Congruence and Equality  congruence equality  For any integers , , and , we have .     Properties of Congruence  We said earlier that congruence modulo behaves, in many important ways, the same way equality does. Specifically, we could prove that congruence modulo is an equivalence relation , which would require checking the following three facts:   Congruence Modulo is an Equivalence Relation  congruence equivalence relation  equivalence relation  Given any integers , , and , and any positive integer , the following hold:    .   If then .    If and , then .     In other words, congruence modulo is reflexive, symmetric, and transitive, so is an equivalence relation.   You should take a minute to convince yourself that each of the properties above actually hold of congruence. Try explaining each using both the remainder and divisibility definitions.  Next, consider how congruence behaves when doing basic arithmetic. We already know that if you subtract two congruent numbers, the result will be congruent to 0 (be a multiple of ). What if we add something congruent to 1 to something congruent to 2? Will we get something congruent to 3?   Congruence and Arithmetic  congruence arithmetic   modular arithmetic Suppose and . Then the following hold:    .  .  .     The above facts might be written a little strangely, but the idea is simple. If we have a true congruence, and we add the same thing to both sides, the result is still a true congruence. This sounds like we are saying:   If then .   Of course this is true as well, it is the special case where . But what we have works in more generality. Think of congruence as being basically equal. If we have two numbers which are basically equal, and we add basically the same thing to both sides, the result will be basically equal.  This seems reasonable. Is it really true? Let's prove the first fact:   Suppose and . That means and for integers and . Add these equations: .  But , which is just a multiple of . So , or in other words,    The other two facts can be proved in a similar way.   One of the important consequences of these facts about congruences, is that we can basically replace any number in a congruence with any other number it is congruent to. Here are some examples to see how (and why) that works:    Find the remainder of divided by .    We could do long division, but there is another way. We want to find such that . Now . Of course , so we can replace the 90 in the sum with 0. Why is this okay? We are actually subtracting the same thing from both sides:   Next, note that , and (since ). So we can in fact replace the 400 with simply a 4. Again, we are appealing to our claim that we can replace congruent elements, but we are really appealing to property 3 about the arithmetic of congruence: we know , so if we multiply both sides by , we get .  Similarly, we can replace 3000 with 3, since . So our original congruence becomes  . Therefore divided by 9 has remainder 8.    The above example should convince you that the well known divisibility test for 9 is true: the sum of the digits of a number is divisible by 9 if and only if the original number is divisible by 9. In fact, we now know something more: any number is congruent to the sum of its digits, modulo 9. This works for 3 as well, but definitely not for any modulus in general.  Let's try another:    Find the remainder when is divided by 7.    Of course, we are working with congruence because we want to find the smallest positive such that . Now first write . We have: , since . Notice further that is congruent to 1 modulo 7. Thus we can simplify further: .  But , so we are done: .    In the above example, we are using the fact that if , then . This is just applying property 3 a bunch of times.  So far we have seen how to add, subtract and multiply with congruences. What about division? There is a reason we have waited to discuss it. It turns out that we cannot simply divide. In other words, even if , we do not know that . Consider, for example: .  This is true. Now and are both divisible by 6. However, .  While this doesn't work, note that . We cannot divide by 6, but we can divide 8 by the greatest common factor of and . Will this always happen?  Suppose . In other words, we have for some integer . Of course is divisible by , as is . So must also be divisible by . Now if and have no common factors (other than 1), then we must have . But in general, if we try to divide by , we don't know that we will get an integer multiple of . Some of the might get divided as well. To be safe, let's divide as much of as we can. Take the largest factor of both and , and cancel that out from . The rest of the factors of will come from , no problem.  We will call the largest factor of both and the , for greatest common divisor . gcd greatest common divisor  greatest common divisor In our example above, since the greatest divisor common to 6 and 8 is 2.   Congruence and Division  congruence division  Suppose . Then .  If and have no common factors then , so .     Simplify the following congruences using division: (a) and (b) .    (a) Both and are divisible by , and and have no common factors, so we get .  (b) Again, we can divide by 3. However, doing so blindly gives us which is no longer true. Instead, we must also divide the modulus 15 by the greatest common factor of and , which is . Again we get .      Solving Congruences  congruence solving   Now that we have some algebraic rules to govern congruence relations, we can attempt to solve for an unknown in a congruence. For example, is there a value of that satisfies, , and if so, what is it?  In this example, since the modulus is small, we could simply try every possible value for . There are really only 5 to consider, since any integer that satisfied the congruence could be replaced with any other integer it was congruent to modulo 5. Here, when we get which is indeed congruent to 4 modulo 5. This means that and and and so on will each also be a solution because as we saw above, replacing any number in a congruence with a congruent number does not change the truth of the congruence.  So in this example, simply compute for values of . This gives 2, 5, 8, 11, and 14 respectively, for which only 14 is congruent to 4.  Let's also see how you could solve this using our rules for the algebra of congruences. Such an approach would be much simpler than the trial and error tactic if the modulus was larger. First, we know we can subtract 2 from both sides: .  Then to divide both sides by 3, we first add 0 to both sides. Of course, on the right-hand side, we want that 0 to be a 10 (yes, really is 0 since they are congruent modulo 5). This gives, .  Now divide both sides by 3. Since , we do not need to change the modulus: .  Notice that this in fact gives the general solution : not only can , but can be any number which is congruent to 4. We can leave it like this, or write for any integer .     Solve the following congruences for .    .  .  .         All we need to do here is divide both sides by 7. We add 13 to the right-hand side repeatedly until we get a multiple of 7 (adding 13 is the same as adding 0, so this is legal). We get , , , ,  got it. So we have:     Here, since we have numbers larger than the modulus, we can reduce them prior to applying any algebra. We have , and . Thus, We got the 72 by adding to both sides of the congruence. Now divide both sides by 9. However, since , we must divide the modulus by 3 as well: . So the solutions are those values which are congruent to 8, or equivalently 3, modulo 5. This means that in some sense there are 3 solutions modulo 15: 3, 8, and 13. We can write the solution: .    First, reduce modulo 14:  . We could now divide both sides by 3, or try to increase 9 by a multiple of 14 to get a multiple of 6. If we divide by 3, we get, . Now try adding multiples of 14 to 3, in hopes of getting a number we can divide by 2. This will not work! Every time we add 14 to the right side, the result will still be odd. We will never get an even number, so we will never be able to divide by 2. Thus there are no solutions to the congruence.       The last congruence above illustrates the way in which congruences might not have solutions. We could have seen this immediately in fact. Look at the original congruence: .  If we write this as an equation, we get , or equivalently . We can easily see there will be no solution to this equation in integers. The left-hand side will always be even, but the right-hand side is odd. A similar problem would occur if the right-hand side was divisible by any number the left-hand side was not.  So in general, given the congruence , if and are divisible by a number which is not divisible by, then there will be no solutions. In fact, we really only need to check one divisor of and : the greatest common divisor. Thus, a more compact way to say this is:   Congruences with no solutions  congruence without solutions  If , then has no solutions.     Solving Linear Diophantine Equations  Diophantine equation   Diophantine equation  Pythagorean triple Discrete math deals with whole numbers of things. So when we want to solve equations, we usually are looking for integer solutions. Equations which are intended to only have integer solutions were first studied by in the third century by the Greek mathematician Diophantus of Alexandria, and as such are called Diophantine equations . Probably the most famous example of a Diophantine equation is . The integer solutions to this equation are called Pythagorean triples . In general, solving Diophantine equations is hard (in fact, there is provably no general algorithm for deciding whether a Diophantine equation has a solution, a result known as Matiyasevich's Theorem). We will restrict our focus to linear Diophantine equations, which are considerably easier to work with.   Diophantine Equations  Diophantine equation  linear Diophantine equation Diophantine equation  An equation in two or more variables is called a Diophantine equation if only integers solutions are of interest. A linear Diophantine equation takes the form for constants .   Diophantine equation solution A solution to a Diophantine equation is a solution to the equation consisting only of integers.   We have the tools we need to solve linear Diophantine equations. We will consider, as a main example, the equation .   Euclidean algorithm The general strategy will be to convert the equation to a congruence, then solve that congruence. This is certainly not the only way to proceed. A more common technique would be to apply the Euclidean algorithm . Our way can be a little faster, and is presented here primarily for variety. Let's work this particular example to see how this might go.  First, check if perhaps there are no solutions because a divisor of and is not a divisor of . Really, we just need to check whether . This greatest common divisor is 3, and yes . At this point, we might as well factor out this greatest common divisor. So instead, we will solve: .  Now observe that if there are going to be solutions, then for those values of and , the two sides of the equation must have the same remainder as each other, no matter what we divide by. In particular, if we divide both sides by 17, we must get the same remainder. Thus we can safely write .  We choose 17 because will have remainder 0. This will allow us to reduce the congruence to just one variable. We could have also moved to a congruence modulo 29, although there is usually a good reason to select the smaller choice, as this will allow us to reduce the other coefficient. In our case, we reduce the congruence as follows:   Now at this point we know will work for any integer . If we haven't made a mistake, we should be able to plug this back into our original Diophantine equation to find :   We have now found all solutions to the Diophantine equation. For each , and will satisfy the equation. We could check this for a few cases. If , the solution is , and yes, . If , the solution is . If , we get .  To summarize this process, to solve , we,     Divide both sides of the equation by (if this does not leave the right-hand side as an integer, there are no solutions). Let's assume that has already been reduced in this way.    Pick the smaller of and (here, assume it is ), and convert to a congruence modulo : . This will reduce to a congruence with one variable, : .    Solve the congruence as we did in the previous section. Write your solution as an equation, such as, .    Plug this into the original Diophantine equation, and solve for .    If we want to know solutions in a particular range (for example, ), pick different values of until you have all required solutions.     Here is another example:    How can you make $6.37 using just 5-cent and 8-cent stamps? What is the smallest and largest number of stamps you could use?    First, we need a Diophantine equation. We will work in numbers of cents. Let be the number of -cent stamps, and be the number of 8-cent stamps. We have: .  Convert to a congruence and solve:   Thus . Then , so .  This says that one way to make $6.37 is to take 121 of the 5-cent stamps and 4 of the 8-cent stamps. To find the smallest and largest number of stamps, try different values of .          Stamps         -1  (129, -1)  not possible    0  (121, 4)  125    1  (113, 9)  122    2  (105, 13)  119          This is no surprise. Having the most stamps means we have as many 5-cent stamps as possible, and to get the smallest number of stamps would require have the least number of 5-cent stamps. To minimize the number of 5-cent stamps, we want to pick so that is as small as possible (but still positive). When , we have and .  Therefore, to make $6.37, you can us as few as 80 stamps (1 5-cent stamp and 79 8-cent stamps) or as many as 125 stamps (121 5-cent stamps and 4 8-cent stamps).    Using this method, as long as you can solve linear congruences in one variable, you can solve linear Diophantine equations of two variables. There are times though that solving the linear congruence is a lot of work. For example, suppose you need to solve, .  You could keep adding 51 to the right side until you get a multiple of 13: You would get 57, 108, 159, 210, 261, 312, and 312 is the first of these that is divisible by 13. This works, but is really too much work. Instead we could convert back to a Diophantine equation: .  Now solve this like we have in this section. Write it as a congruence modulo 13: so . Now go back and figure out :   Of course you could do this switching back and forth between congruences and Diophantine equations as many times as you like. If you only used this technique, you would essentially replicate the Euclidean algorithm, a more standard way to solve Diophantine equations.     Suppose , , and are integers. Prove that if , then .    Suppose . Then is a multiple of , or in other words, for some . But then , and since is an integer, this says is a multiple of . In other words, .     Suppose , , and are integers. Prove that if and then and .    Write out the remainder classes for .    , ,   , and .    What is the largest such that and are in the same remainder class modulo ?

This means and for some integers and . Consider . We have: .  In other words, is more than some multiple of , so .
